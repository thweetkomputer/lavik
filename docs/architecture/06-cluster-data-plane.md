# Cluster data plane

## Responsibility and boundary

This subsystem makes a Keylane process a Redis Cluster data node: it decides,
for every client command, whether this node may serve it, must redirect it to
the owning node, or must refuse it with a standard cluster error. Ordinary
requests never consult an external control plane; each node answers from its
locally committed view of slot ownership, authority, and readiness.

The module under `include/keylane/cluster/` and `src/cluster/` exposes six
seams:

- `TopologyCache` holds the committed `ServingState` and publishes it
  atomically.
- `AuthorityGuard` is the request-path authority boundary:
  `CaptureAndAdmit` records the routing and finite-lease proof, while
  `RegisterAndRecheck` atomically registers in-flight work and closes the
  publication race. Free `Admit` and `AuthorityUnchanged` are pure routing
  helpers, not request-path substitutes.
- `ClusterRouter` is a set of pure functions over a committed state: slot to
  owning node, MOVED target, and client-facing endpoint selection.
- `NodeControlInstaller` is the only state-changing seam. It validates and
  atomically publishes full state, installs finite leases and fences, drains
  retired request generations, reconciles source-history holds, revokes source
  capabilities, dispatches typed replication directives, and consumes a
  prepared promotion only at the finite-lease boundary.
- `ClusterControlPort` supplies complete target state for the static-file
  adapter and in-memory tests.
- `MetaControlClientService` owns leader discovery and the one outbound
  Meta-to-Data control session. It maps authenticated wire values into the
  node controller; neither it nor replication writes `TopologyCache`
  directly.

The Redis/storage boundary adds a transport-neutral final seam:
`storage::MutationPrecondition` carries the captured admission through every
suspending storage preparation step and validates it at logical publication.
Storage depends only on a callback and opaque shared context, not on cluster
types.

The module is free of Redis wire concerns. Wire mapping (error texts,
discovery reply shapes) lives in the Redis serving layer, and internal
authority state (terms, grants, fence reasons) never crosses into RESP. The
hash-slot function is shared with storage: keys hash with
`storage::RedisSlot` (CRC16-XMODEM with `{hashtag}` support, modulo 16384),
and a static assertion ties the two slot spaces together. Slot ownership
decides *which node* serves a key; the worker mapping inside a node
(`slot % worker_count`) is unchanged, and transaction coordination keeps its
own arbitration boundary — the cluster layer reaches it only through a
generic per-shard validator hook that knows nothing about clusters.

Cluster mode is a startup-only, process-wide choice. The runtime
(`ClusterRuntime`: topology cache, authority guard, node controller, action
adapter, and resolved announce addresses) is installed
before any listener accepts a client; in standalone mode it is null and every
cluster code path is inert.

## ServingState: the published unit of truth

A `ServingState` is an immutable snapshot built and validated as one unit:
the node table, the shard groups with their slot ranges, per-group authority
(primary identity, term, grant) and readiness (storage and population), and
the computed slot-to-group map. Construction rejects malformed node ids,
duplicate node or group ids, dangling primary or replica references, and
inverted, out-of-range, or overlapping slot ranges. Coverage may be partial:
an unbound slot is a first-class state, not an error.

Publication is a single atomic `shared_ptr` swap, so topology, grants, and
readiness always appear together. A writer mutex serializes the rare
control-plane publications, and an odd/even publication sequence brackets the
snapshot store and version update. Readers accept a snapshot/version pair only
when equal even sequence reads surround it, so they cannot pair a newly stored
snapshot with the preceding version. The cache also carries a monotonic logical
version for publication ordering and tests. A content-identical republication
(decided by a content hash over the semantic state) is a no-op that keeps the
existing snapshot, version, and sequence, so reload churn is invisible.
Authority decisions never consult the global version: admission captures the
snapshot it decided against, and the owner-side re-check compares a per-group
authority token — owner identity, term, grant, and readiness, precomputed at
build time — so an unrelated group's republication does not disturb
in-flight work.

Request-path reads go through a thread-local snapshot cache that re-reads only
the publication sequence per call; a hit returns the last observed snapshot
with no shared-memory writes at all. This keeps the admission gate free of
cross-worker serialization — a direct `atomic<shared_ptr>` load per request
would serialize on the toolchain's internal spin bit.

Readiness is per group and deliberately excludes the grant bit: a fenced
group is not "still loading", it has no safe owner. Keyed requests consult
only the groups their slots map to, so one group's recovery does not stall
traffic owned by healthy groups; keyless commands consult the aggregate.

## Admission and fencing

`Admit` is a pure function over one committed snapshot and a request view
(distinct key slots, write intent, connection READONLY state, loading
whitelist membership), so the full decision matrix is testable offline. Its
evaluation order mirrors Redis `getNodeByQuery`:

The request record retains only the first slot and, when present, one distinct
slot as a CROSSSLOT witness. More distinct slots cannot change the decision,
and every request that proceeds beyond admission therefore carries exactly one
slot without a general-purpose vector allocation or footprint.

1. Loading: no committed snapshot, or an involved group is not ready. Only
   whitelisted commands (health, discovery, configuration, subscription
   management) are served; everything else is LOADING.
2. First-key coverage: the first key's slot has no owner, or its owner is
   this node's fenced group — CLUSTERDOWN. This outranks the cross-slot
   check, matching Redis.
3. Cross-slot: the remaining keys hash to other slots — CROSSSLOT.
4. Ownership: this node's granted group owns the slot — serve; a READONLY
   connection on a replica of the owning group serves reads locally as an
   explicitly stale read; otherwise MOVED to the primary. A fenced remote
   primary still receives the redirect: the target applies its own grant
   gate and answers CLUSTERDOWN, so a redirect never lands a client on a
   writable fenced node.

Commands without keys — including commands whose key extraction fails, such
as a malformed `EVAL` numkeys — admit locally (readiness still applies) and
produce their own argument errors, the same treatment Redis gives zero-key
commands.

Admission alone cannot fence writes: a request admitted just before a
topology change could mutate afterwards. Two owner-side re-check choke points
close the outer dispatch and transaction-scheduling races after publisher,
database, snapshot, and order-gate waits:

1. Non-transactional writes re-check in `ExecuteCommandBody` after the
   database gate is held. A changed authority means nothing has executed yet,
   so the request is re-admitted against the current snapshot and answered
   honestly with a redirect or error; a benign republication re-arms the
   request with the current snapshot.
2. Transactional writes install a per-shard validator on the
   `tx::Transaction`. The hook runs on the owner shard immediately before
   every shard callback and aborts that shard when authority changed. A
   single-shard transaction provably ran nothing and gets the re-admission
   answer; a multi-shard transaction may have mutated a shard whose check
   raced the fence, so its outcome is undeterminable and the connection
   closes without a fabricated reply.

Handlers can still suspend after either choke point while acquiring key/store
locks, reading an old value, or allocating storage. Every client keyspace write
therefore carries the same admission as a `storage::MutationPrecondition`.
Transactions copy it into each `TxShardWrites` receipt; direct handlers keep it
alive until their storage task completes. `WriteRecordLocked` evaluates the
nonblocking callback on the owning shard after all potentially suspending
preparation and immediately before WATCH invalidation and staging/index
publication. The hash no-op path performs the same check before its observable
WATCH invalidation. Internal rollback explicitly bypasses the inherited check
so it can restore an already-started transaction. Replica replay carries no
client precondition. Background expiration and Tomb Raider instead carry the
exact revocable expiration token granted after lease activation; they enforce
its `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` deadline at their own final mutation cuts.

The shared admission records whether any storage publication began and whether
a later final check failed. If the first attempted mutation is rejected, the
command discards its prepared reply, re-admits against current state, and sends
that fresh redirect or error. If an earlier participant already began and a
later one is rejected, the aggregate outcome is indeterminate and the server
closes the connection without fabricating a retryable result. This finalizer
also covers errors swallowed inside Lua and the single-shard EXEC fast path.

`EXEC` re-evaluates the union of its queued commands' slots at execution
time: spanning slots fails the whole transaction with CROSSSLOT, and a write
transaction whose slot moved redirects or refuses as a whole. Its
single-shard fast path, which never builds a `tx::Transaction`, re-checks
after taking the key guard. Lua `redis.call` writes re-check before
dispatch and again on the owner hop; script key access is additionally
confined to the slot set the script was admitted with. Invoking a Function
loaded with the `no-cluster` flag is refused in cluster mode, with Redis's
exact error text. Top-level blocking writes (List and Sorted Set operations and
`XREADGROUP`) re-run admission on every attempt after reacquiring the database
gate. Each concrete storage attempt registers a fresh in-flight authority guard
and releases it before entering the waiter registry or sleeping; a dormant
client therefore cannot delay an authority drain. Read-only `XREAD` and the
keyless `WAIT` carry no mutation authority and register no such guard.
Replication replay is exempt from every re-check: applied commands are
already ordered by the replication stream and carry no client fencing
semantics.

Reads are intentionally not re-checked. A read gated at admission may observe
data committed before a concurrent fence — the same staleness window Redis
Cluster clients accept across failover. Writes have no such window: the
combination of admission, the owner-side choke points, the final storage
precondition, and per-group tokens guarantees a stale topology causes
redirection or temporary unavailability, never a second writer.

Only writes retain ownership of the admitted snapshot across suspension
points. Reads finish their decision while the thread-local cache keeps the
snapshot alive and carry no per-request shared reference afterwards, matching
their intentionally absent owner-side re-check.

Executions register their admitted groups when they pass the re-check and
unregister at completion, so a fence publisher can observe whether any
admitted write is still running for an affected group. The accounting lives
in per-group striped atomic counters owned by the published snapshot: the
request path performs one atomic increment on the registering thread's
stripe, with no lock and no allocation, and aggregation happens off the
request path. Publication shares the replaced snapshot's counter into every
group whose authority token is unchanged, so executions admitted under
token-equal snapshots drain together, while a changed group starts a fresh
counter and fencing drains the replaced snapshot's. Registration is bracketed
by publication-sequence loads — an odd sequence covers the state/version
update and a completed publication changes the even token — so a drain either
observes a concurrent registration or the registrant observes the sequence
change and rolls back.

Ordinary writes retain that registration through their handler. Top-level
blocking List and Sorted Set writes and `XREADGROUP` instead retain it only
across one concrete mutation attempt, because time spent waiting for data
performs no mutation and must not pin the replaced authority generation. Their
immediate EXEC and Lua forms never enter the waiter registry and remain inside
the enclosing transaction or script authority window.

The node controller retains the replaced immutable snapshot as a drain token.
A new lease, source authorization, or destructive rebuild for that group is
refused until the old counter reaches zero. An explicit Fence is acknowledged
only after the local fence is published, source export capabilities are
revoked and joined, and the old request generation has drained. This makes the
acknowledgement a usable old-authority exclusion proof rather than a transport
receipt.

## Meta control session and finite authority

A Meta-managed node starts fenced after every process restart. It restores no
serving checkpoint, lease, term floor, directive outcome, leader directory, or
other positive authority from local storage. The only durable authority is the
Meta Raft state; boot, replication-history, session, challenge, and lease state
are process memory. A fresh 160-bit boot identity prevents messages for a prior
process from becoming current even though the durable data files remain.

The Data process connects outward from configured numeric seed endpoints. It
tries the accepted leader hint, the latest in-memory committed directory, then
the static seeds, with full-jitter exponential backoff from one to ten seconds.
An unresolved seed remains a fallback even when a learned member currently
announces the same endpoint, because endpoint ownership can legitimately change
across reconfiguration. A response replaces the in-memory directory atomically
only after its member identities and the peer's authenticated URI principal
agree. A learned dial target pins that exact prior committed principal against
the new `ServerHello`; only an unresolved static seed may bootstrap its binding
from the authenticated Hello. The hint and directory are intentionally not persisted. Connect, TLS,
Hello, read progress, and write progress each have a ten-second bound; backoff
resets only after an accepted session has produced a valid `HeartbeatAck`.

The session uses control protocol v1 with framing independent of TCP packets.
A fixed header carries type, length, per-direction sequence, and CRC32C. Frames
are at most 16 KiB. A frame-sized `FullDesiredState` is sent directly as one
typed frame. Complete objects that exceed one frame use Start/Chunk/End plus
total length and SHA-256; chunks stream without per-frame application
acknowledgements. A complete FDS gets `FullStateApplied`, directives get typed
receipt stages, and terminal results get `ResultCommitted` or
`NoLongerTracked`; soft `OperationEvidence` has no application ack.
The complete desired-state cap is 512 MiB, while each opaque directive,
result, or operation-evidence field is capped at 256 KiB. These are abuse
ceilings, not normal sizing goals:
16 KiB keeps one authority frame cheap and indivisible; 256 KiB matches the
durable Meta payload-field bound; 512 MiB matches Meta's snapshot hard ceiling;
and the 64 KiB writer budget provides one frame of headroom for each priority
class while a large object streams one chunk at a time. One reader and one
serialized writer own each direction, read-ahead is disabled, and a ten-second
progress deadline closes a stuck session. That deadline is deliberately much
longer than the default Raft heartbeat/election cadence but still bounds failed
peer detection. Authority and reliable messages take precedence between bulk
frames; priority cannot interrupt bytes already handed to the kernel. Only one
complete-object transfer may be active at a time, so Start/Chunk/End sequences
cannot interleave. Queued transfers retain shared ownership of their encoded
bytes until completion or failure.
Meta also accounts every retained node projection by the capacities of its
encoded string and decoded owning graph under one 2 GiB worker-local budget
(`4 * 512 MiB`). A build first reserves 1 GiB (`2 * 512 MiB`) and then adjusts
to its measured weight; the permit follows the shared batch through initial
send, live installation, and replacement. The two-generation budget is derived
from an installed/replacement overlap, not the 4096 session count. A highly
structural object can therefore be rejected below its wire cap, and aggregate
normal projections cannot multiply the global topology into TiB-scale output
ownership.

Control protocol v1 has no delta format. Initial connection, reconnection, and
every semantic projection change transfer a complete `FullDesiredState`. The
object contains global topology plus each group's partition replication epoch
and the receiving node's policies, immutable population manifests, current
directives, and at most one exact source-history hold addressed to that node.
The hold carries its recovery generation and source/population incarnation but
no serving or export authority. The source applied index is a
diagnostic/order watermark; the projection SHA-256 is the semantic dependency
for leases and directives. A higher index with identical semantic content is
therefore harmless. Lower indexes reject, exact index/object replays are
idempotent, and one index naming different bytes invalidates memory authority
and closes the session. Installation validates and builds the entire immutable
state before one publication; partial transfer never changes serving state. A
group's partition replication epoch cannot regress even when the global
topology epoch advances.
Membership entries carry node and assignment identities only. The committed
group owner and matching owner assignment are projected independently from
the active-grant bit: they classify the heartbeat role while `grant_active`
alone authorizes serving. Protocol v1 has no redundant member-role field that
could disagree with them.

Heartbeat carries common health followed by exactly one tagged role payload:
no role information, an authority lease request, or replica candidate
progress. A committed owner with an active renewable grant sends only the
lease request; without one it sends no role information and never falls
through to candidate reporting. A non-owner member with a coherent live Ready
frontier sends only candidate progress. Candidate
progress includes the exact local membership assignment, manifest revision and
digest, partition replication epoch, completed rebuild source lineage, and a
typed bounded next-LSN vector sampled after successful apply. Candidate and
health are volatile Meta observations, not Raft commands. The challenge names the
exact projection and complete group authority anchor. `sent_at` is captured
immediately before the first socket write, and the granted duration is applied
to that monotonic timestamp, so a delayed response cannot extend authority.
Business heartbeat sequences accept only the next message or an exact replay
of the preceding message; the latter receives the cached exact ack. Invalid
challenge content changes only the lease decision and cannot suppress common
health observation. Meta derives role from the installed committed projection,
not from the payload tag; an authority/no-role heartbeat atomically clears any
candidate left from the same node's prior replica role. The authenticated
session completion path immediately withdraws the exact generation's
candidate. Generation replacement, boot replacement, committed freshness
changes, and Meta leadership changes independently invalidate it, so the
selector never waits for TTL after a known disconnect or role change.

After the initial projection is applied and validated, Meta also publishes a
compact leader-local runtime record for cluster status and leader-owned
workflows. The record follows the current session and FDS incarnation, retains
the replication-history id authenticated by `ClientHello`, timestamps health
at receive, and records a lease decision only after the corresponding Ack
write succeeds. A successful grant becomes serving evidence only when a later
ready heartbeat from the same session and projection confirms it; the
heartbeat that first obtains the grant cannot confirm itself. Cached Ack replay
does not renew either timestamp. Replacement, session close, leadership loss,
and shutdown remove the record. This is a one-way observational feed: Data
authority and lease evaluation never read status state back.

An FDS replacement quiesces the heartbeat producer before publishing the new
controller projection. A heartbeat already written under the old projection
is detached from lease authority; its exact ack may still be consumed for wire
progress, but its lease decision is ignored. Heartbeats resume only after the
new desired object is installed and `FullStateApplied` is written, so an old
Ready proof cannot be evaluated against a new assignment, manifest, or
population epoch.

Directive execution also emits typed, volatile `OperationEvidence` for the
started and completed phases. Each report is bound to the current session and
boot, authenticated reporter, exact local assignment, operation, population
anchor, and replication history, and carries a SHA-256 of its bounded evidence
body. Reports that fit one frame use the soft-message lane; larger reports use
the same Start/Chunk/End object-transfer machinery under an evidence-specific
cap and are admitted only after whole-object hash and schema validation. Meta
audits and discards a well-formed report that has become stale without closing
the authority session; malformed session, boot, framing, or content-hash data
fails the session.
Meta's typed candidate/evidence query results retain that authenticated boot
beside the reporter and assignment, so later directive/evidence construction
never has to race a second session lookup.
Reporter-local history remains the compatibility diagnostic `history` value.
The candidate's source boot, assignment, and history are independent fields;
only equal source lineages and equal population anchors/flow dimensions form a
comparison domain.

A committed slot-map cut cannot reuse an existing grant. Meta rejects a slot
ownership or config-epoch change while any affected source or destination
group still has an active grant. The controller must fence all affected
groups, commit the complete replacement map, and then activate fresh
authorities. This committed-state precondition complements the per-session
Fence/FDS drain: a source that has not consumed the replacement can never keep
an old lease while the destination begins serving the same slot.

Finite leases are required only for a Meta-managed local primary. Admission
and the final mutation recheck both prove the current session, group
assignment, term, authority/grant revision, projection, and unexpired
monotonic deadline. Session loss, expiry, committed authority change, local
storage loss, or an explicit fence invalidates memory authority immediately.
Startup-not-ready and runtime storage loss are distinct controller states:
startup may later publish ready, while runtime loss latches the current boot
failed, publishes storage-unready, joins older directive admission and every
control transition already across the loss cut, then performs a final source
revocation and target-population cancellation and drains retired requests.
Storage writers set a process-wide latch and close the request gate
immediately; worker zero drives this asynchronous controller barrier. An
uncertain cleanup result stops the server without a clean checkpoint. Neither
a later FDS nor a population proof can clear the latch; recovery requires
process restart.

Meta's leadership expiry and every granted lease are bounded by the Raft
election lower bound `D`, and a leader stops sessions synchronously on
demotion. Data constructs and rechecks lease deadlines with Linux
`CLOCK_BOOTTIME`, so suspend time consumes rather than preserves authority.
The worker's relative timer rechecks that suspend-aware deadline in slices no
larger than 25 ms or one quarter of the granted duration, whichever is
smaller. Request admission therefore rejects at the first post-resume touch,
while source-capability invalidation begins within one bounded slice rather
than waiting out the pre-suspend remainder of a long lease. Tying the slice to
the grant avoids imposing a fixed 25 ms lag on deliberately short leases.
Before issuing the first otherwise-valid lease for each group, boot, authority
anchor, and leadership generation, Meta waits `2D` on the same suspend-aware
clock: one maximum prior lease plus a second `D` safety margin. This remains
safe under the deliberately loose assumption that the Meta host's elapsed-time
clock advances no more than twice as fast as the prior Data host's; scheduling
delay can only postpone a grant. The leader-local evidence resets on leadership
or process restart, so a later owner cannot overlap a predecessor even when no
Fence acknowledgement is available.

NuRaft's peer-liveness timer uses active `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` time, which does not
advance while a Meta host is suspended. Data control therefore also compares
that clock with `CLOCK_BOOTTIME`. Once their accumulated divergence reaches
`D`, it closes the leadership generation's authority sessions and requests an
immediate NuRaft resignation. A sole member, for which resignation is a no-op,
must run for another full `D` of active monotonic time before authority can be
eligible; a further suspend extends that wait. All FDS boundaries, directives,
results, and lease grants pass this gate. Thus an old multi-member leader
cannot resume after a replacement election and refresh the same stale identity
through a handoff entry that had already matured before suspension.

Graceful Data shutdown stops new client and control-message admission, then
immediately cancels replication target and source transports. In particular,
closing source flows releases retained backlog cursors before request drain, so
a stopped downstream cannot make shutdown wait forever on an admitted write.
The control session reader observes its stop after the current socket operation
(bounded by the normal progress deadline), synchronously invalidates the
session's memory lease, closes the stream on its owning worker, and joins the
short directive admission lane plus the final fail-closed session-loss
transition. Terminal rebuild observation is separately session-scoped, so
abandoning a dead wire cannot block reconnection; shutdown still cancels and
joins the underlying native attempt before storage teardown.
Only after the control barrier may the process finish draining client requests.
It then joins the already-cancelled replication work and creates its storage
shutdown checkpoint. This ordering prevents a completed control-side mutation
from landing after the checkpoint that is supposed to describe the clean
shutdown. If native-flow cancellation, source revocation, or candidate root
retirement has an uncertain outcome, the barrier returns that failure; the
process skips the normal checkpoint and exits unsuccessfully rather than
recording an unsafe state as a clean shutdown.

Directives carry distinct 128-bit operation, directive, attempt, target
assignment, and source assignment identities. The common assignment field
continues to denote the target membership incarnation; the explicit source
assignment denotes the exporting membership incarnation. The proposer never
reuses either membership id for a later incarnation, while Meta durably retains
only the current or most recent value per node to catch direct replay.
The other IDs distinguish workflow, durable command, and execution attempt.
The wire recipient is separate from the rebuild target: rebuild runs at the
target, while authorize/revoke runs at the source without rewriting the common
source/target identity used by native replication. The node controller checks
the exact installed projection, full authority anchor, recipient boot, exact
target and source member assignments, local source/target role, manifest
revision/digest/content, partition replication epoch, and one-group constraint
before calling `ReplicationManager`. A directive that passes the first check
holds an admission token across readiness publication and the possibly
suspending `ReplicationManager` registration, then rechecks its generation and
all anchors immediately before crossing that action seam. FDS replacement,
fencing, session invalidation, lease expiry, and externally observed population
proof loss advance the generation before publishing their invalidating
boundary. Their async transition waits for every older token to reject or
finish registration and only then performs its final revoke/cancel pass. Thus a
directive cannot appear behind the cleanup represented by `FullStateApplied` or
`FenceAck` even when its action adapter suspended after validation. A boot-local
fence floor also rejects directives through the fenced counter tuple: rebuilds
compare the local target assignment, while source authorize/revoke compares the
local source assignment. A fresh assignment or a strictly newer committed
counter tuple is therefore distinguishable from replay of fenced authority.
Retiring an active local source owner in a full-state replacement advances that
same source rejection floor for the exact retired assignment before reconnect
dispatch resumes. This recovers the exclusion boundary when the old control
session missed its explicit fence, while a fresh boot or a later assignment
cannot synthesize or inherit that proof from an ownerless FDS.
The bounded worker timer may still be queued briefly after a host resume, so a
renewal also compares the old deadline with `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` synchronously. If
the old lease is already due, the renewal path runs that exact expiration
transition first: it advances the authority generation, retires the stale
timer, and joins source/directive cleanup before considering the replacement
grant. A same-anchor heartbeat can extend only a lease that never expired, so
pre-expiry admissions cannot be revived by a delayed timer.

A projected source-history hold is reconciled under the same FDS barrier but
remains separate from authority. It is accepted only for the local exact
member/boot/history/population incarnation and one monotonic recovery
generation. FDS alone cannot arm retention: the matching ordinary
authorize-source directive must first pass the full control and source-ledger
checks. Fence, lease expiry, and session replacement still revoke and join
source capabilities without deleting the armed hold, allowing a later
authorized candidate to reuse the shared backlog. Removing the hold from FDS,
population loss, storage failure, shutdown, or restart releases it. The hold
is excluded from the established export-preservation identity, so adding or
removing it alone cannot tear down an otherwise unchanged ONLINE stream and
open an idle-history rotation gap.

A frozen-source authorization remains a current Meta directive while its
selected candidate catches up. Full-state installation always clears the
prior control session's admission; when its complete data and authority
identity remains unchanged, the already-ONLINE export may stay quarantined
while exact replay of the retained directive reauthorizes its stable export
scope. Stronger authority or population changes still cancel and join the
stream. The directive is replaced only after the candidate reports every flow
at the required frontier; the projected hold never substitutes for this
capability.

The encoded directive schema retains bounded `payload`, `preconditions`, and
`force` fields. V1 appends `initialize-empty-population` as directive value 4
and `promotion-prepare` as value 5, preserving the earlier wire values.
Initialization uses its payload for exactly one canonical target
replication-history id and has no source node, source authorization, or
replication connection; zero-valued wire source fields normalize to an empty
domain source. Promotion prepare instead owns versioned typed payload and
precondition codecs that bind parent history, required per-flow frontier,
excluded group term, and old-authority-exclusion hash. Other v1 kinds require
both strings empty except `authorize-source` in its typed frozen-source mode.
That mode binds the recovery generation to the exact excluded term, authority
version, and grant revision and returns a versioned source history/all-flow
frontier/proof hash through the existing terminal result and evidence path.
Every kind requires `force=false`. Meta and NodeControl repeat these checks
before the action seam, so the native adapter never treats an unknown
predicate or forced operation as satisfied.

Initialization reuses the ordinary directive, FDS, operation receipt, and
population-proof lifecycles. NodeControl first closes readiness and serving,
then passes a source-less `RebuildIdentity` to `ReplicationManager` only after
the current session, boot, target assignment/history, authority, grant,
manifest, and partition epoch all match. The manager reuses the durable
full-sync fence, resets and hands off every physical partition, installs an
empty Function catalog, promotes the candidate root, and publishes a
ReadyToken with an empty flow cut. The token remains valid when the completed
directive disappears from otherwise matching FDS. A definite pre-promotion
failure stays LOADING and lets Meta abort/fence the operation; an uncertain
reset, abort, or promotion latches fail-stop until restart and never enables
lease admission.

Receipt stages distinguish acceptance, execution start, and completion. A
controller rejection moves directly from
`Accepted` to `Completed` and reports a rejected result without started
evidence; admitted work emits `Started`, and any later non-success is a failed
execution. For admitted work, completed evidence is written after `Completed`
but before the terminal result, while the operation is still live at Meta.
Rebuild admission returns before readiness so a newer current rebuild can enter
ReplicationManager and supersede the old attempt; an exact completion observer
alone emits `Completed` and the result. The rebuild's own transition to
not-ready does not invalidate its admission token; concurrent external control
transitions still do. FDS then cancels prior completion observers and reconciles
the native target population before its applied acknowledgement; a fence also
cancels any in-progress target attempt and joins its completion observer before
`FenceAck`. A lease grant is admitted only after these cleanup counters clear
and does not disturb a still-current directive. The result reports a truthful
success, precondition rejection, or runtime failure. Meta durably commits the
exact
terminal receipt before returning `ResultCommitted`. With no Data-side journal,
a lost acknowledgement causes the committed directive to be replayed and its
idempotent replication identity to resolve the work again. After current
session, projection, identity and fence checks, NodeControl may return an
exact still-valid population completion through a non-mutating lookup even
while that population is serving. This path neither clears readiness nor
starts work; no match retains all ordinary destructive-admission and drain
checks. No local result record can reopen authority after restart.
The production node controller and replication control state share worker
zero: validation and exact-result lookup do not suspend or acquire a global
state mutex. Other workers request population observations through the
replication owner's asynchronous API, while data-flow progress remains
worker-local and independently sampled.

`promotion-prepare` is target-executed and storage-mutating like rebuild, but
is admitted only from an ownerless, grantless FDS whose candidate population
is already Ready. Its terminal success bytes are a versioned
`PromotionPreparedEvidence` containing the frozen parent frontier,
population/catalog durability tokens, and child history. The same bytes are
sent in completed operation evidence and the terminal result; Meta commits the
result receipt before the Failover operation can enter `promotion-prepared`.
The boot-local completion prevents result replay from repeating durability or
history creation. Prepare never opens writes, expiration, or source export,
and protocol v1 has no `activate-promotion` directive.

Activation instead reuses the ordinary lease transition after
`ActivateAuthority` is committed and the successor FDS is installed. The
controller first installs the finite lease provisionally, translates the exact
current FDS identity into an in-process activation input, and asks
`ReplicationManager` to consume the retained prepare context. The group,
candidate assignment/boot, immediate successor term and authority version,
monotonic grant revision, manifest, partition epoch, Ready population,
durability tokens, and child history must all still match. Success calls the
same private role/population activation half as standalone promotion, but does
not itself open expiration. After the suspending activation returns,
NodeControl revalidates the exact lease generation and deadline, then
synchronously installs a fresh storage expiration token carrying that absolute
deadline. The token is checked again at active-expiration durable append and
disk-full in-memory delete cuts and at Tomb Raider mutation cuts, so delayed
activation or a late lease timer cannot extend authority. Rejection removes
the provisional lease and leaves the candidate LOADING. Exact lease replay is
idempotent after activation.

Meta treats serving as a later observation boundary. The heartbeat that
requests the first successful lease is recorded before its Ack is written, so
it cannot prove that Data applied the lease and activation. Only a subsequent
ready heartbeat from the same session, boot, projection, assignment, term,
authority, and grant confirms serving for workflow completion.

A completed population is content-scoped by group, membership assignment,
immutable manifest, and partition replication epoch. `BeginGroupTerm` fences
authority but does not mutate that content, so FDS reconciliation preserves a
matching Ready population across a term-only change only when the epoch remains
unchanged, and reports its candidate proof under the newer committed term. An
epoch-only change first revokes Ready and serving eligibility and requires a
new rebuild before another lease can be granted. In-progress rebuilds remain
term-scoped and are cancelled unless the FDS
still carries their exact term and a rebuild successor. Grantless groups have
no `ServingState` owner or bound slots, but their committed membership remains
in the controller identity view so this preservation is possible. For any
member incarnation retained across projections, NodeControl also requires the
group's config epoch, term, authority version, grant revision, manifest
revision/digest, and partition replication epoch to be monotonic even while
the group is ownerless; a full remove-and-reassign identity is the explicit
boundary at which a new incarnation may reset those counters. Once Meta
activates the candidate, the next FDS can publish the retained proof; if no
proof survived (for example after a reboot), the granted-but-unready target may
run a rebuild while it remains unable to serve or obtain a lease.

## Redis wire contract

Cluster routing errors are simple error lines with Redis 7.2 texts; clients
dispatch on the first token, and the encodings are identical under RESP2 and
RESP3. Deliberately unsupported administrative mutations use stable Keylane
`ERR` replies.

| Condition | Reply |
|---|---|
| Slot owned by another node | `-MOVED <slot> <host>:<port>` |
| First key's slot unbound, or self is its fenced primary | `-CLUSTERDOWN Hash slot not served` |
| Keys span multiple slots (including an `EXEC` union) | `-CROSSSLOT Keys in request don't hash to the same slot` |
| No ready committed state | `-LOADING Redis is loading the dataset in memory` |
| Transient retryable condition (e.g. flush in progress) | `-TRYAGAIN <message>` |
| `SELECT 0` | `+OK` (a no-op; every other database index is rejected) |
| `SELECT` with a nonzero index | `-ERR SELECT is not allowed in cluster mode` |
| `COPY` with a `DB` option | `-ERR Copying to another database is not allowed in cluster mode` |
| `REPLICAOF` / `ADDREPLICAOF` | `-ERR REPLICAOF not allowed in cluster mode.` |
| Unauthorised `FLUSHDB`, `FLUSHALL`, or catalog-changing `FUNCTION` subcommands | `-ERR <command> is not allowed in cluster mode` |
| Unknown `CLUSTER` subcommand or wrong arity | `-ERR Unknown CLUSTER subcommand or wrong number of arguments for '<sub>'` |
| Execution outcome undeterminable | No reply; the connection is closed |

MOVED always names the owning node's concrete advertised address; the
empty-host "dial the startup node" convention exists only for the self entry
in discovery replies. Both MOVED and discovery select the port by the
requesting connection's TLS state — TLS connections receive the target's TLS
port, falling back to the plain port when the target offers no TLS — mirroring
Redis `getNodeClientPort`. Discovery replies (`CLUSTER SLOTS`/`NODES`) are
built per request from one committed snapshot and never cache encoded output.

A gate rejection inside `MULTI` marks the transaction dirty, so `EXEC` fails
with EXECABORT as in Redis. `EVAL`/`EVALSHA`/`FCALL` are treated as writes for
admission — a script that only reads still redirects to the primary — while
their `_RO` variants are treated as reads; declared keys must hash to one
slot, and `redis.call` access outside the admitted slot set is rejected with
Redis's non-local-key error. Read-only global commands and process-local
administration (INFO, CONFIG, DBSIZE, SCAN, SCRIPT cache management, and
similar) keep node-local semantics and are governed only by readiness.
Meta-managed nodes reject `FLUSHDB`, `FLUSHALL`, and catalog-changing
`FUNCTION LOAD`, `DELETE`, `FLUSH`, and `RESTORE`: they mutate durable
process-wide state but carry no slot from which finite authority can derive a
group lease and drain cell. Static compatibility mode permits them only when
this process is the sole granted local slot-owning primary group. It binds the
request to that group's first slot, so the ordinary generation recheck and
in-flight drain protect an SIGHUP role change. Static replicas, slotless
primaries, and ambiguous multi-group configurations reject them because they
cannot supply that drain proof. Queued Function catalog mutations contribute
the representative slot to an `EXEC` union and pass through the same final
recheck. `FUNCTION KILL` and `FUNCTION STATS` remain available while loading
so an executing Function can be stopped or inspected; they do not mutate the
catalog.

## CLUSTER subcommands and discovery surface

Cluster mode serves `SLOTS`, `NODES`, `MYID`, `INFO`, and `KEYSLOT` from the
committed state; every other subcommand receives Redis's unknown-subcommand
error. `KEYSLOT` is a pure function of the key and answers even before the
first state is published. `CLUSTER INFO` reports `cluster_state:ok` exactly
when slot coverage is complete, the assigned/ok slot counts, the known-node
count, the number of slot-serving primaries as `cluster_size`, and the
configuration epochs; with no gossip, the pfail/fail and message counters are
always zero. `CLUSTER NODES` emits nodes.conf-format lines with the `myself`
mark on the local entry and no bus-port semantics (`@0`).

`HELLO` reports `mode:cluster`, `INFO` reports `redis_mode:cluster` in its
Server section, and a `# Cluster` section carries `cluster_enabled:1`, so
standard clients and Sentinel-style tooling detect the mode. Standalone mode
is unchanged: it keeps the legacy replication-derived `CLUSTER NODES`/`SLOTS`
shim that fakes full coverage, and its replica-redirect MOVED shim never runs
in cluster mode because the two topology sources are mutually exclusive.

## Control ports and configuration

`ClusterControlPort::RefreshTarget` is the synchronous static-control path. It
reads the file adapter's target and asks `NodeControlInstaller` to publish only
a complete, validated state; on error the previous state stays in effect.
Meta-controlled state enters through the asynchronous client/session path and
the same installer, which can wait for replication revocation and request
drain before acknowledging a transition.

`StaticClusterControl` loads a Redis `nodes.conf`-format file shared by every
node. The file carries no `myself` mark; the local entry is identified by
matching the process's bind host and port against node lines (wildcard binds
match on port alone) and must match exactly one entry, or startup validation
fails. Migration markers (`[slot-<-id]`, `[slot->-id]`) are rejected outright
rather than silently misparsed — there is no importing/migrating flow to give
them meaning. The bus port and gossip bookkeeping fields are validated and
dropped; replica wiring is validated before groups are assembled. Only
slot-owning primaries form groups, with the primary's node id as the group
id, and statically configured primaries hold a permanent grant. Readiness
follows storage recovery: the first publication is not ready, so the gate
answers LOADING until recovery (and any startup RDB import) completes.
Static topology does not wire a replication role lifecycle, so every static
node starts without durable expiration authority and rejects both native and
Redis replication export. Read paths still hide values after their absolute
deadline. Recovery retains an expired winning record in the index and does not
append a tombstone or reclaim it while authority is withheld; this preserves
its suppression of older versions without creating a local durable mutation.
Meta-managed mode authorizes native population transfer only through its
fenced lifecycle. When an authoritative promotion later grants expiration,
the ordinary active-expiration loop can durably retire those retained winners.

The static adapter loads once at startup — a first-load failure is fatal —
and reloads on SIGHUP, which wakes the main loop through its own eventfd
(the shutdown eventfd treats any write as a stop request and is never
shared). A failed reload keeps the previously published state; an identical
file republishes nothing. Node ids come from the file, keeping `MYID` stable
across restarts, and the file carries only data ports: every node is assumed
to serve TLS on one cluster-wide configured port. `InMemoryClusterControl`
publishes programmatically built states — including fenced or not-ready
states the static adapter never produces — through the same seam for
in-process tests.

Startup-only directives configure the subsystem: `cluster-enabled` (default
`no`); exactly one of `cluster-static-nodes-file` or repeatable
`cluster-meta-seed`; `cluster-node-id` for Meta mode; and
`cluster-announce-ip`, `cluster-announce-port`, and
`cluster-announce-tls-port`. Announce values
default to the first non-wildcard bind address and the corresponding listen
ports; a wildcard bind leaves the announce host empty so discovery self
entries keep the startup-node convention. Meta mode requires a canonical
40-character lowercase node id and at least one numeric seed. Static and Meta
control are mutually exclusive. Both modes refuse coexistence with either
replication upstream directive (two topology sources never mix; runtime
`REPLICAOF` is rejected separately at the command layer), and require at least
one reachable announced client port so MOVED and discovery can always name an
endpoint — a TLS-only deployment is valid.

Data-to-Meta mTLS is optional and all-or-none. When enabled, the Data client
reuses its existing replication TLS CA/certificate/key and presents the
committed `keylane://node/<node-id>` identity. A Meta listener reuses that
member's existing Raft TLS CA/certificate/key and presents its sole
`keylane://meta/<server-id>` URI SAN. Plaintext mode treats network isolation
as its trust boundary; neither side silently falls back when a TLS identity is
partially configured.

## Current scope limits

The data plane deliberately excludes: ASK/ASKING and the
importing/migrating compatibility flow, the gossip bus protocol, protocol
deltas, Data-side durable control journals, shard Pub/Sub, non-uniform TLS
ports in static `nodes.conf` mode, dynamic node-id allocation, group-scoped
authority for persistent
no-key mutations, and the remaining `CLUSTER` management subcommands
(`SETSLOT`, `MEET`, `FAILOVER`, `ADDSLOTS`, and similar).

## Verification

The admission decision matrix, builder and parser validation, content-hash
publication semantics, finite lease lifecycle, frame and complete-object
codecs, projection and source-hold validation, frozen-source admission,
prepared activation, serving confirmation, drain behavior, TLS-aware endpoint
selection, in-flight counter concurrency and cell sharing, and the CLUSTER
wire texts and reply shapes are unit-tested through pure seams and the
in-memory adapter. The three-node static-cluster end-to-end suite verifies
routing, redirects,
read-only replica admission, cluster-mode command restrictions, static export
denial, expiration-authority state, INFO/CLUSTER replies, and topology reload.
A real-process plaintext Data-control gate starts three Meta members and a Data
node, exercising follower-seed redirect, full-state install, heartbeat
observation, leader failure and reconnect, stale-member restart, and graceful
shutdown. Separate single-Meta gates cover mTLS identity and TLS/plaintext mode
selection. The cluster-create process gate starts one bootstrap Meta and two
Groups of initially unregistered, fenced primary/replica Data nodes. It covers
automatic and explicit slot layouts, interactive and `--yes` confirmation,
real sparse-population initialization, native full rebuild and continued
replication, Redis routing/redirect/cross-slot behavior, and exact node-level
diagnostics when one replica is stopped. The controlled-failover process gate
then carries one replicated write through the production operator command,
requires the promoted owner to serve it under term 2, and proves that repeated
writes to the former owner return only `MOVED` after cutover.
