# Meta control plane

## Boundary and state model

`keylane-meta` is a separate C++ process for durable cluster metadata. It
embeds NuRaft and uses its native Asio service for Raft peer sockets, timers,
and TLS. One Celer worker owns the configured Unix and/or TCP administrative
listeners and the process-lifetime Data-control listener; a bounded proposal
executor keeps
synchronous NuRaft API entry and WAL I/O off that worker. NuRaft and
proposal-executor threads return typed notifications or coroutine handles
through Celer's foreign MPSC mailbox, which reuses the worker's normal wake
sequence and eventfd. The main Keylane data-plane executable remains
Raft-free. Followers keep accepting Data connections long enough to return the
committed member directory and leader hint. Only a caught-up leader installs
the publisher that may create sessions, project desired state, evaluate lease
challenges, or accept results. Demotion cancels that publisher and begins
closing, then joins, all sessions and leader-scoped tasks from its leadership
generation before the coordinator reports the transition complete. Shutdown
first stops the creation, membership, and controlled-failover reconcilers
without waiting for remote results, then cancels administrative result waits
and drains every listener, then quiesces Data sessions and all
NuRaft/proposal-executor producers, waits for the foreign executor's accepted
prefix to reach the Meta worker, and only then stops the generic Celer runtime.
An active demotion or first shutdown drain is fail-stop if the worker
mailbox cannot accept its notification: reporting success would permit a later
leader epoch to reuse authority that was never revoked. Once shutdown has
synchronously drained the worker, later reconciler cancellation and object
destruction are no-ops and do not depend on a still-running executor.

The process exposes three independent network responsibilities. `--addr` is
the local Raft listener, `--data-control-addr` accepts Data-node control
sessions, and the required concrete `--ctl-addr` is the remote operator/Admin
listener. Admin also defaults to a mode-0600 Unix socket unless an explicit
socket choice is supplied; Unix and TCP share one dispatcher, authentication
policy, capture limiter, and retained-reply budget. The manifest and durable
membership descriptor own the advertised routes, which may name explicit
proxies rather than these local binds. Wildcard Admin binds and port zero are
invalid.

The state machine owns one `MetaStores` value containing eight committed
stores:

| Store | Durable responsibility |
|---|---|
| Identity | Data-node certificate principal bindings and retired identities; Meta-member principal bindings |
| Topology | Groups, membership, owners, epochs, manifest references, and slot ranges |
| Policy | Versioned, content-addressed policy documents and retirement state |
| Grant | Group terms and authority grants, including fencing and lease parameters |
| Operation | Idempotent operation lifecycle, current directives, durable terminal receipts, and exported/prunable terminal summaries |
| Population manifest | Immutable, content-addressed partition/epoch documents and explicit pruning |
| Failover recovery | Group-scoped recovery generations, old-source and excluded-authority anchors, source-hold intent, recovery requirement, and optional frozen frontier proof |
| Audit | Log-index-ordered command verdicts in a bounded hash chain |

`ApplyCommitted` is the only mutation path. It dispatches absolute-value and
revision-checked commands and enforces cross-store invariants such as unique
principals, one data group per node, monotonic terms and epochs, and valid
policy/grant/operation references. Group membership, owner, slot, population-
manifest, partition-replication, and `UpdateNode` endpoint changes advance the
cluster topology epoch. `SetSlotMap` validates a complete candidate before
publication and rejects any ownership or config-epoch change involving an
active grant. Every affected source and destination group must first be
fenced, preventing a lease for the old projection from spanning the cut.
Initial identity registration can be projected at
epoch zero before any group exists. The administrative membership proposer,
not operator input or deterministic apply, generates each assignment
incarnation from the OS CSPRNG; the topology store's bounded last-value index
only catches direct replay. Non-terminal operations persist structured policy
dependencies and an
optional replication-history binding; phase evidence is accepted only when
its exact `(group, node, assignment)` membership incarnation, reporter boot,
operation, group term, manifest, partition replication epoch, and history
match committed facts. Those identity anchors remain in the durable evidence
summary rather than being reconstructed from the node's membership at apply.
Directive validity is a continuously maintained committed invariant, not only
an admission check. After every accepted command, apply deterministically
rechecks each bounded live directive against the exact active source and
target assignments, group term, authority and grant revisions, and population
manifest/partition epoch. It removes only the stale attempts and advances each
affected operation's phase revision once, forcing reconcilers with an older
CAS view to reload. This catches source or target removal/reassignment,
term/authority/grant changes, fencing or revocation, and population changes
without a command-specific cleanup list. Replaying the anchor mutation sees
the directive already absent and is a no-op; snapshot decode rejects a stale
directive as corrupt aggregate state.
A domain-invalid command consumes its Raft index, leaves the requested domain
state unchanged, and records the rejection in the audit chain. Unknown
commands, corrupt durable bytes, contradictory replay at an existing index,
and impossible apply ordering fail stop. Replaying the same entry at the same
index is idempotent and produces the same verdict and audit record;
correctness does not depend on apply running only once.

Controlled failover uses one top-level durable operation whose immutable
single-attempt intent and phase blobs have strict versioned codecs. Candidate
selection occurs once from the current compatible Candidate Plan; the recovery
store deliberately contains no candidate or attempt history. The submitted
no-phase state is rendered as `planning`; its ordered phase graph is
`source-holding`, `source-held`, `old-authority-excluding`,
`old-authority-excluded`, `candidate-caught-up`, `promotion-preparing`,
`promotion-prepared`, `authority-activated`, then `serving`. A registered
proposal-validation hook forbids skipped phases, more than one live failover
for a group, arbitrary changes to exclusion/frontier/prepared proofs, and a
term, prepare, or activation that does not match the exact committed authority
and population anchors. Its sole same-stage frontier change is the validated
candidate-backed downgrade at `old-authority-excluded` after source
availability is lost.

The recovery record is created before the first phase and is independently
snapshotted. It binds one monotonic group generation to the old source
assignment/boot/history, excluded term/authority/grant, manifest and partition
epoch, hold/recovery flags, and an optional all-flow frozen proof. Within a
generation, immutable anchors and frozen proof bytes cannot change. Proof
state moves only conservatively: `pending` resolves to `exact` or
`unavailable`; replacement of the exact old boot, assignment, or replication
history changes `exact` to `unavailable` while retaining its historical frozen
proof; and `unavailable` cannot upgrade or rewrite that proof. Operation
receipts and recovery records have independent
CAS revisions, so every replica repeats a typed apply-time validation: a queued
proof-loss command is rejected if a successful exact frozen-source receipt was
ordered ahead of it in Raft. Final clear retains a generation/revision
tombstone so delayed replay cannot recreate an old hold.
Before the authority cut, definitive old-source loss first checkpoints
`pending -> unavailable`; that state is a durable degrade latch, so reconnect,
leader replacement, or a queued `BeginGroupTerm` cannot resume controlled
cutover. Only after that checkpoint may the operation publish its unknown-loss
terminal result and recovery handoff.
Safe terminal cleanup first converts the existing generation to a durable
false/false release tombstone, keeps that record until the old source
acknowledges an FDS without the hold, and only then clears it. A new or
successor-generation record cannot start in this released state. A successor
may atomically replace an active generation only after that generation has
durably entered recovery-required handoff, so an independent recovery driver
cannot steal a hold still owned by controlled cleanup. The record
pins its source assignment and population manifest until final clear. An
independent uncontrolled operation can later read a recovery-required handoff
without a parent/child operation relationship.
Once the handoff flags are durable, source availability belongs to the group
record rather than to the terminal operation. The reconciler scans these
records independently, including after operation archival, applies the same
leader-tenure reconnect grace, and CAS-downgrades `pending` or `exact` to
`unavailable` if the pinned boot/assignment/history/hold is lost. An exact
frontier is retained as immutable historical evidence. The already-published
terminal outcome remains an audit statement about the attempt at
terminalization; later source loss is represented by the newer recovery-record
revision.

All model collections, command fields, snapshots, active operations, archived
summaries, policy bytes, and the audit window have explicit bounds. An
unreferenced population-manifest insertion is charged against the exact bytes
remaining in the aggregate snapshot, including headroom for its audit record;
the decode count ceiling is derived from that durable byte limit rather than
an unrelated collection limit. An oversized snapshot fails that snapshot
round. Once uncompacted WAL or consecutive snapshot-failure guards fire, the
coordinator rejects ordinary proposals with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`. It simulates
an explicit recovery command against one committed view and admits exactly one
whose effect advances the bounded recovery chain: empty-result terminalization
of a generic live operation; canonical bounded failover bootstrap,
proof-availability checkpoints, and attribution of an already-committed
authority or observed serving fact; failover terminalization and its exact
same-generation handoff/release/clear; movement of terminal records into the
archive; removal of existing archived summaries or terminal receipts; removal
of an existing unreferenced manifest; or an audit prune whose serialized
window is smaller even after its own audit record. Failover exceptions are a
typed allowlist: they cannot dispatch a Data directive or commit a new
authority mutation. A no-op prune, stale revision, arbitrary nonempty result,
or other nominally whitelisted command is rejected before Raft append.
Failover archive admission additionally requires the same cross-store gate as
normal proposal and apply: safe outcomes must have fully cleared their
recovery record, while recovery-required outcomes must first persist the exact
hold/recovery handoff. Archival therefore transfers availability ownership to
the group record instead of leaving cleanup dependent on archived operation
intent. Its narrow same-generation availability downgrade remains admissible
under WAL or snapshot pressure.
The recovery reservation follows the actual NuRaft proposal until it resolves,
even if its caller times out, so another recovery step cannot overtake an
uncertain outcome. After enough state is removed, a successful snapshot clears
the snapshot/WAL pressure rather than Data-local state synthesizing authority.
Snapshot decode revalidates group-set and authority-anchor lockstep plus every
active identity, policy, and manifest reference before exposing the recovered
aggregate. An active authority additionally requires nonzero term and config
epochs, matching the Data-control serving representation.
Audit retention is replicated: the default bounded-rotate mode evicts the
oldest entry and records durable loss watermarks, disabled mode suppresses
ordinary records while retaining policy transitions, and strict-export mode
rejects proposals at capacity until an operator exports and prunes. In strict
mode the separate audit-capacity reservation also follows each Raft proposal
until it actually resolves, including after a local timeout, so overlapping
proposals cannot overbook the window.

## Proposal and observation flows

`MetaCoordinator` is the in-process API used by reconcilers, the Data-session
publisher, and the administrative adapter. `Propose` accepts model commands
rather than NuRaft types. On the leader it takes one atomic committed view,
applies fail-safe and
registered semantic validation, injects the transport-authorized actor and a
readable proposal time, encodes the current durable format, submits to
Raft through the proposal executor, and returns the apply result carried by
NuRaft's completion. It never re-reads a record that bounded audit rotation may
already have evicted. Followers return a not-leader status without appending.
Membership workflows hold one exclusive leader-local lease through completion,
so NuRaft never receives overlapping configuration changes.

Committed subscribers atomically receive a complete `CommittedView`, its
cursor, and a bounded ordered subscription. Replay can redeliver an index, so
consumers deduplicate by index. Queue overflow cancels the subscription and
requires resynchronization from a new full view. Each NuRaft role callback
synchronously records its exact edge in `MetaLeadershipRelay` before scheduling
a Celer drain, so a stalled worker or coordinator cannot collapse a rapid
Leader/Follower/Leader sequence into its final role. The relay also preserves
edges racing startup attachment and makes shutdown detachment a lifetime
barrier. `MetaCoordinator` consumes one ordered event queue for reconciler
registration and role edges. A Follower event always cancels and joins every
leader reconciler, then invalidates volatile observations, before a later
Leader event can restart anything. Promotion still waits for NuRaft to catch
the state machine up.

`MetaControlProjector` is a pure function over one atomic committed view. It
produces a canonical node-specific `FullDesiredState`: the global Meta/Data
directories and topology, each group's partition replication epoch, that
node's group/authority policy, referenced population manifests and policies,
live directives whose explicit recipient is that node, and an active recovery
record's source-history hold only for its exact old-source node incarnation.
The source applied index is an ordering/diagnostic
watermark; SHA-256 of the canonical semantic projection is the dependency used
by leases and directives. The publisher sends a full projection on session
acceptance and whenever that hash changes. Control protocol v1 has no delta
format, so an index advance with identical content does not create network
churn and a reconnect never depends on retained incremental history.

Control v1 is unreleased and its schema is replaced in place. Data and Meta
must use matching layouts; missing Hello flow counts and untyped rebuild
payloads fail validation rather than defaulting to a local worker count.

The Data-control wire protocol has a fixed versioned header, per-direction
sequence, payload length, and CRC32C. Frames are bounded to 16 KiB. Larger
objects use Start/Chunk/End with a declared total length and SHA-256; desired
state is capped at 512 MiB and individual opaque directive, result, or
operation-evidence fields at 256 KiB. These are defensive ceilings rather than
expected object sizes:
16 KiB keeps small authority messages atomic and bounds per-frame latency;
256 KiB equals the durable Meta payload-field cap; and the 512 MiB hard ceiling
matches the snapshot size class so malformed projections cannot allocate
without limit. The writer admits four frame sizes, enough for one outstanding
frame in each authority, reliable, bulk, and soft class. Chunks have no
stop-and-wait acknowledgement. The serialized writer schedules authority and
reliable frames ahead of bulk chunks between kernel writes, while one reader
and disabled socket read-ahead keep each session's memory ownership explicit.
Only one complete-object transfer is active in a direction at a time; queued
transfers retain shared ownership of their encoded bytes, so Start/Chunk/End
sequences cannot interleave or outlive their payload storage.
Projection and directive-set validation stream their canonical encodings into
SHA-256 and retain only a bounded vector of directive references; they never
materialize a normalized FDS or one encoded buffer per directive. Receive-side
parsing necessarily overlaps the accumulated wire bytes with the owning
decoded fields, so the 512 MiB value is a protocol abuse ceiling rather than a
512 MiB process-memory promise. The consuming decoder releases the wire buffer
on success or failure before installation can suspend, bounding that overlap
to parsing instead of retaining it across the atomic replacement.
Connect, handshake, session progress, and individual socket writes are bounded
at ten seconds; this is well above the default 100 ms heartbeat and 300--600 ms
election cadence while still turning a stuck peer into a finite failure.
Sockets that have not completed TLS when enabled, a valid `ClientHello`, and a
committed active node/certificate binding also consume one of 4096 pending-
handshake permits. The listener closes excess sockets before starting their
session coroutine. A follower retains its permit through the bounded redirect
write. A leader releases it only after the connection has atomically claimed
the committed node's single post-authentication slot and joined the current
leadership generation; duplicates are rejected until that exact owner exits.
Consequently anonymous/redirect work is capped at 4096, and projection/FDS
holders are capped at one per committed node-record slot (validated active at
claim time) even when a peer stalls or that record retires before session
cleanup.
Those per-node objects also share one weighted 2 GiB projection budget derived
as two overlapping generations times encoded-plus-decoded 512 MiB size
classes. Each build reserves the encoded/decoded pair before projection and
then adjusts to the batch's actual retained string/vector capacities. The
permit follows shared ownership through transfer and live installation, so
4096 small sessions remain possible while a few abuse-sized projections cannot
multiply common topology and manifest data into a TiB-scale allocation.

Heartbeat is the periodic Data-to-Meta observation message. Protocol v1 carries
common health followed by exactly one tagged role payload: no role information,
an authority lease request, or replica candidate progress. A session accepts
only the next business sequence or an exact replay
of the previous heartbeat; an exact replay gets the cached exact ack. Data
quiesces heartbeat projection reads during an FDS replacement. Any outstanding
ack for the old object is consumed without applying its lease decision, and
production resumes only after the new object is acknowledged.
Candidate progress names the authenticated reporter's exact committed member
assignment, term, manifest revision and digest, partition replication epoch,
completed rebuild source lineage, and typed next-LSN vector.
Meta rejects reports from active nodes that are not members of the named group
and old assignment proofs after remove/re-add; group queries retain the
reporter identity with each proof. Reporter-local history is bound to the
history announced in `ClientHello`; source history in candidate progress is an
independent lineage anchor. Health ingestion is independent of challenge
validation, so a bad renewal request cannot hide useful liveness evidence.
Meta derives role from committed FDS facts rather than trusting the tag, and
replaces common health plus candidate state under one observation-store lock.
An authority/no-role heartbeat, or rejected candidate, clears any older
candidate for that node. Session teardown also withdraws the exact
generation's candidate immediately; a stale teardown cannot clear evidence
from a replacement generation.
Challenges name the exact projection and complete group authority anchor.
Meta grants only while it remains the caught-up leader, and caps duration at
both committed policy and the configured leadership-validity bound. An
otherwise-valid first grant for a new group/boot/anchor/leadership identity is
held behind a leader-local `2D` quarantine on Linux `CLOCK_BOOTTIME`, where `D`
is the maximum prior lease and the second `D` is a safety margin derived from
the same Raft election lower bound. Data measures and synchronously rechecks
the lease on that suspend-aware clock, starting immediately before its first
heartbeat write rather than at ack receipt. The `2D` interval tolerates the
Meta clock advancing up to twice as fast as the prior Data clock; scheduling
can only extend the wait. Losing volatile quarantine evidence restarts the
whole interval rather than recovering an unsafe wall-clock deadline.

NuRaft's peer-response expiry uses active `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` time, so a Meta
host suspend can otherwise preserve an old process's cached leader verdict
while other members elect a replacement. The Data-control worker compares
that clock with `CLOCK_BOOTTIME`; accumulated suspend divergence of at least
`D` closes the leadership generation's authority sessions and synchronously
requests immediate NuRaft resignation. In a multi-member cluster the old
generation cannot become eligible again. NuRaft intentionally keeps a sole
member leader, so that case must instead run for another full `D` of active
time; a further suspend restarts the wait. Live FDS boundaries, directives,
result proposals, and grants all pass this barrier. It covers the same-identity
case whose ordinary `2D` handoff entry matured before suspension.

Directives separate the wire recipient from the rebuild target: rebuild and
promotion-prepare are delivered to the target, while authorize/revoke is
delivered to the source.
The common assignment field always names the target membership incarnation;
the durable directive carries a separate source assignment and the committed
partition replication epoch. Both must exactly match committed topology and
the installed group view.
The durable and wire codecs keep bounded `payload`, `preconditions`, and
`force` fields. V1 uses `payload` for `initialize-empty-population`, where it
carries the target Data session's authenticated replication-history id, and
defines versioned payload/precondition bodies for `promotion-prepare`.
`rebuild` and `authorize-source` share a versioned payload containing the source
flow count advertised with its boot/history in `ClientHello`. Meta commits that
layout in both directives; projection and replay never infer it from the
recipient's workers or a newer source session. Source authorization and the
native target handshake both check it against the actual source layout.
Frozen `authorize-source` and `promotion-prepare` carry preconditions; ordinary
rebuild/authorization requests do not. `revoke-sources` requires both fields
empty, and all kinds require `force=false`. The prepare bodies bind parent
history and required flow frontier to the committed old-authority exclusion
term and hash.
Meta transition apply and Data admission reject malformed or misplaced bodies,
so the replication adapter cannot silently ignore a predicate or override.
Operation, durable directive, execution attempt, and assignment-incarnation
identities remain distinct. Assignment ids are proposer-generated
128-bit values that are never reused across incarnations; the topology store
retains the most recent value per node to reject direct remove/re-add replay
without growing an unbounded historical set. Accepted, Started, and Completed
receipts are session observations. A pre-start controller rejection omits
Started and moves directly from Accepted to Completed; Meta requires its result
status to be rejected. Once Started was observed, a non-success result is an
execution failure rather than a rejection. The terminal result is authoritative
only after Meta commits an exact `MetaTerminalReceipt` through Raft and responds
`ResultCommitted`. That first commit advances the live operation revision, so
an already-issued phase mutation cannot pass its old CAS after the terminal
result becomes durable; an identical result replay is idempotent and does not
advance it again, while conflicting content fails closed. Before a first result
is committed, apply revalidates the
matching live directive against that same current aggregate anchor; a result
racing an anchor mutation is therefore rejected even if a future mutation
path were to miss eager cleanup. An already committed receipt remains
immutable history and an exact retry still resolves to its original commit
index after the authority later advances. Terminal receipts are pruned only
through an explicit replicated command after the retry-retention window.

Data sends typed `OperationEvidence` when directive execution starts and
completes. The envelope carries the session and boot, exact reporter
assignment, operation, population and history anchors, phase, and a SHA-256 of
the evidence body. A report that fits one frame uses the soft lane; a larger
report uses the `ObservationEvidence` Start/Chunk/End transfer with a bounded
256 KiB body plus envelope. Meta performs whole-object hash and schema checks
before admission. A report that is structurally valid but stale against the
latest committed view is audited and discarded without disrupting an
otherwise current authority session; malformed session, boot, framing, or
content-hash data closes it.

For promotion prepare, terminal success is opaque only to the generic journal:
the Failover validator decodes `PromotionPreparedEvidence`, requires its parent
history and frozen frontier to satisfy the current phase, and requires the
same bytes and hash in a successful terminal receipt and a TTL-fresh operation
observation from the candidate's current boot/session before constructing the
durable evidence summary. The evidence query applies the TTL boundary itself;
it does not rely on a periodic cleanup sweep. This is the Raft boundary between
Data-local prepare and later authority activation. A control stream may remain
connected across it, but Data must receive later committed FDS/lease authority
before local activation; no single RPC may cross the commit point on Meta's
behalf.

`MetaObservationStore` is deliberately outside `MetaStores`: it is volatile,
leader-local evidence and is never encoded into a command, WAL, snapshot, or
committed subscription. Admission authenticates the tuple `(node identity,
boot incarnation, controller-local session generation)` and accepts only the
current generation. A new generation atomically removes the node's older
observations. Candidate progress must match committed node/group/assignment,
term, manifest revision and digest, and partition replication epoch state.
The compatibility `history` field remains reporter-local; the internal
selector uses the separately stored source assignment, boot, and history.
Operation evidence also
matches the committed operation and its replication-history binding. The
typed candidate/evidence query results include the authenticated reporter boot
alongside node and assignment, so a reconciler never joins a payload to a
second session lookup that could cross a reconnect. The canonical evidence-
summary conversion copies that complete reporter incarnation. Operation
evidence's committed anchors are rechecked deterministically when embedded in
an operation-phase command, closing the race between leader-local validation
and Raft apply. A committed epoch-only change therefore invalidates old
candidate and operation evidence even when term and manifest do not move.
Committed changes proactively purge stale evidence,
and queries filter again against one current committed snapshot. Startup and
each entered leader epoch clear soft state; every observed follower edge clears
sessions, observations, and their local diagnostic ring even when another
leader edge is already waiting behind it.

Soft-state memory is bounded independently of its field validators. The store
admits at most the committed node-domain cap of 4096 session keys and candidate
reporters per group, at most 1024 evidence phases per reporter and per operation
(the durable operation-evidence cap), and at most 65,536 total observations.
Using the full node-domain bound for candidates avoids making report arrival
order an implicit member-selection policy. Exact logical byte accounting covers
retained variable fields and their lookup-key copies: the global 68 MiB budget
is one direct frame plus identifier allowance per maximum node, while a node's
289 KiB share holds one maximum streamed evidence object, one heartbeat frame,
and its index allowance. Replacement, generation purge, revalidation, TTL
expiry, and leader reset update the same counters. Ordinary diagnostic
ingestion keeps its previous latest-wins value on capacity rejection.
Heartbeat candidate replacement is stricter: it clears old role evidence
before admitting the replacement. Soft state cannot grant or restore
authority.

`CandidatePlanFor` is an internal, read-only function seam rather than an
administrative command or RPC. At one fixed receive-time cut it selects only
current-session, current-boot, Ready, healthy, non-draining replicas whose
assignment and population anchors still match committed facts. Each report has
a non-extendable TTL deadline; planning does not depend on a global observation
revision, so unrelated heartbeats cannot restart the calculation. Exact
manifest/source lineage and flow dimension define a compatibility domain;
multiple domains stop the plan. Within one domain the selector removes vectors
strictly dominated component-by-component. A unique greatest vector wins,
equal greatest vectors choose the lowest node id, and incomparable maxima choose
the lowest envelope-deficit tuple `(sum as uint128, max, node id)`. The latter
is an explicit best-effort data-loss policy, not a claim of a lossless latest
node. The self-contained result is returned immediately; this layer adds no
yield/resume revalidation lifecycle.

## Controlled failover workflow

The authenticated Admin `failover` verb starts only an operator-triggered
controlled failover. Admission requires a consistent active owner and finite
grant, no active recovery handoff or same-group failover, and one eligible
candidate from `CandidatePlanFor`. It persists that exact candidate
assignment/boot, its source lineage, and the operator-supplied bounded
`attempt_timeout_ms` duration in the immutable operation intent; the workflow
never silently switches candidates. The Admin connection has a separate
caller-supplied wait duration. Expiry of that wait, disconnect, or leader
change does not cancel an accepted operation.

`MetaControlledFailoverReconciler` owns the operation on each caught-up leader.
Its pure planner derives at most one next command from the committed operation,
recovery store, current observations, and Data runtime snapshot. When a leader
tenure first observes a committed operation, it turns the persisted duration
into one `steady_clock` deadline. Phase changes, receipt commits, control
reconnects, and subscription resynchronization within that tenure do not
refresh it. Demotion joins the old owner and discards the local clock value; a
new leader or restarted process resumes from snapshot/WAL state and exact
directive receipts, then grants the recovered operation one full new duration
instead of comparing an untrustworthy cross-host wall-clock timestamp. A short
absence of the same Data incarnation receives a bounded revalidation grace
because leader change clears volatile sessions; a replaced boot, exact terminal
failure, grace expiry, or attempt-deadline expiry is definitive for that
attempt.

Before cutting service, the reconciler creates the recovery record, projects a
source-wide history hold to the exact old-primary incarnation, dispatches an
ordinary source authorization, and waits for both its successful terminal
receipt and the acknowledged FDS hold. Only then does `BeginGroupTerm` remove
the old grant. In the fenced successor term, frozen-source mode reuses the
authorize-source result/evidence path to capture an exact all-flow frontier and
proof hash while retaining export to the selected candidate. If the old source
is unreachable after the cut, the record moves monotonically to unavailable
without discarding a previously captured historical frontier or proof. A
selected candidate already at or beyond that frontier can still complete
exactly. If it is behind, the only permitted recovery-basis rewrite is a
same-stage `old-authority-excluded` transition that lowers the required
per-flow vector to that candidate's current exact progress and replaces the
exclusion hash with the candidate-backed unavailable proof. Recovery then
continues with unknown loss instead of waiting for the old boot.

The candidate must report every applied flow at or beyond the chosen frontier.
Until it does, the exact frozen-source authorization remains the operation's
current directive and therefore remains projected through FDS replacement or
session reconnect with its original directive revision. The
`candidate-caught-up` transition retains it once more; entering
`promotion-preparing` replaces it with the one exact promotion-prepare
directive. The reconciler commits that directive's matching terminal receipt
and evidence before atomically assigning the successor with
`ActivateAuthority`. The new FDS and current-session finite lease make Data
consume the retained prepared context through its ordinary local promotion
activation. A later ready heartbeat that matches that exact lease proves
serving; only then does the operation complete.

Failure handling follows the authority cut. Candidate loss before
`BeginGroupTerm` aborts controlled failover and releases the hold while the old
primary remains authoritative. Old-primary loss before the cut aborts the
controlled attempt, but first latches the source proof as unavailable and then
retains a `recovery_required` handoff for a separate uncontrolled operation.
Candidate loss after the cut also terminalizes this
attempt with recovery required instead of waiting for that candidate to
restart; after authority activation, a replacement additionally requires a
new term. Old-primary loss after the cut never blocks a surviving candidate:
Meta retains any historical frozen proof for audit, marks the source
unavailable, and either preserves an exact outcome when the candidate reached
that frontier or rebases once to the candidate's lower per-flow cut with
unknown loss. This version contains no detector, automatic uncontrolled
driver, or multi-candidate retry loop.

Attempt-deadline handling follows the same authority cut. Before
`BeginGroupTerm`, expiry aborts and releases the hold only when the old primary
is currently confirmed; an unconfirmed old primary instead produces unknown
loss and retains a recovery-required handoff. After `BeginGroupTerm`, expiry
terminalizes the controlled operation with recovery required and leaves the
group fenced. If authority activation already committed, that durable fact wins
the race with expiry and the recovery handoff requires a new term. Likewise, a
current-session serving proof wins an expiry race and completes the already
serving operation. Committed frozen proof and monotonic proof-availability
downgrades are persisted before an expiry result so an independent recovery
workflow receives the strongest safe handoff.

Terminal results encode the failure stage, reason, recovery-required flag,
proven per-flow frontier, and an `exact`, `bounded`, or `unknown` loss class. A
safe pre-cutover abort is exact because authority never moved. After the cut,
a failed attempt reports exact only while the recovery record still has an
available exact source proof; this describes a proven recovery frontier, not a
serving candidate. A successful completion reports exact when its phase still
uses the historical frozen frontier and the candidate reached it, even if the
source later became unavailable. Rebasing to the selected candidate's lower
frontier reports `unknown`; the `bounded` value is available to a recovery
driver that can prove a non-exact bound. `data_loss_possible` is retained in
the generic operation archive. After a successful serving proof or a safe
pre-cutover abort, cleanup persists the false/false release tombstone, waits
for the exact old FDS acknowledgement when that boot is present, then clears
the recovery record. A terminal operation that requires recovery keeps both
record and hold intent. A failover operation cannot move into the generic
archive until the release is fully cleared or the matching recovery-required
handoff is durable. Generic `completeop` and `abortop` cannot bypass this
lifecycle.

The workflow has one hard attempt deadline during each continuous Meta leader
tenure. It is distinct from the Admin wait: per-flow catch-up, prepare
durability, FDS delivery, the full existing finite-lease handoff quarantine,
and the confirming heartbeat may outlive the initiating request. At expiry the
reconciler starts no new catch-up, promotion, or authority effect, but first
attributes already committed proof, authority, and serving facts before
terminalizing the attempt. A frozen proof does not shorten the quarantine.
Because leadership or process replacement deliberately reconstructs a full
monotonic budget, the persisted duration is not a cluster-wide absolute
wall-clock completion bound. A post-cutover expiry leaves the group unavailable
until an independent recovery workflow advances it.

The reconciler emits one structured log when the visible phase changes, with
`operation`, `group`, `phase`, `candidate`, and `old_source`. Its one terminal
log uses `operation`, `group`, `terminal`, `phase`, `loss`,
`recovery_required`, `frontier`, and `reason`. Planner conflicts and deferred
proposals are distinct records. The same-stage frontier rebase is reflected in
the terminal loss/frontier fields. These identities stay in logs and operation
results rather than Prometheus labels, avoiding a per-operation or per-node
metric cardinality domain.

## Durability and recovery

The durable source of truth is the newest completed state-machine snapshot plus
the following Raft WAL. Snapshot capture is serialized with commit and copies
an exact applied-index cut; a writer thread performs serialization and file I/O
after capture. A snapshot becomes eligible for log compaction only after its
atomic durable publication succeeds. Incoming snapshots are size-bounded,
decoded completely, and installed synchronously as one replacement state.

WAL v1 uses checksum-protected `log-<first-index>.seg` files. Segments roll at
a size trigger. Compaction writes the complete surviving suffix to a synced
`compact-<first-index>.ready` intent before replacing the old segment set;
startup finishes such an intent after a crash. A reported pre-publication
failure leaves both the live index and old segments authoritative. Append
batches become durable at NuRaft's flush hooks;
membership state and vote state use atomic rename plus file and directory
sync. Recovery retains the intact contiguous prefix and truncates a torn tail.
A checksum-valid segment or compact-intent header with an unsupported format
version is rejected before recovery modifies any files.
The older prototype's `raft_log.dat` and `LSN1` snapshots are intentionally
incompatible and cause startup to fail with an explicit format error.

Before NuRaft opens its network or election timer, a pristine initial member
loads the canonical full Meta vector from `--initial-cluster-manifest` and
atomically publishes it as `cluster_config.dat`. A one-, three-, or five-voter
genesis differs only in vector length. Every member starts the same ordinary
randomized election; there is no distinguished bootstrap candidate. The
manifest is rejected once any durable config exists and is never read on
restart. `initial_bindings.dat` retains that exact genesis descriptor set
until local committed apply has observed every identity binding. It
survives election-time config copies and restarts, then is atomically removed
after `initial_bindings_complete.dat` is published as a permanent tombstone;
the tombstone prevents a completed zero-index genesis from being mistaken for
the config-first publication crash prefix. A pristine process with no manifest
instead persists
`waiting_joiner.dat` before its singleton placeholder config and disables its
initial election. That marker makes restart and partial dynamic-join catch-up
remain election-disabled, and is durably removed only after the joiner applies
the identity bindings through its committed config entry. An invite may
publish that config before the joiner receives a WAL segment; the marker keeps
that recoverable prefix distinct from an incomplete ordinary member.
The first persisted NuRaft vote also publishes `raft_started.dat` before the
vote itself. For genesis and ordinary members this irreversible boundary makes
loss of both the vote and WAL distinguishable from a process that never opened
Raft; waiting joiners retain their explicitly narrower pre-WAL recovery rule.

After either lifecycle converges, `transport_bindings.dat` records the exact
full descriptor set and the state-machine watermark that proved or followed
its identity bindings. An ordinary restart may use those descriptors only
while replay remains below that watermark. Committed dynamic membership
changes reuse the same baseline: `save_config()` publishes a bounded
`transport_bindings.next`, replaces `cluster_config.dat`, and durably promotes
the candidate. Recovery either discards a candidate paired with the old config
or completes a candidate paired with the new config; any other pairing fails
closed. Snapshot installation uses the validated snapshot's embedded NuRaft
configuration and identity projection to update this same config/baseline pair
and finish local genesis or join catch-up. Retired genesis bindings still prove
that initialization completed; they grant no active membership. Extra bindings
may belong to the normal two-phase membership workflow.

The durable snapshot also supplies redo evidence for an interrupted installation.
Before transport or elections start, recovery validates the complete snapshot
and compares configuration-entry indices. A newer snapshot configuration replaces
an older disk configuration; equal-index configurations must agree. A later disk
configuration must lie beyond the snapshot's applied index and match its exact
surviving WAL entry. Election-disabled waiting joiners retain their narrower
invite-before-WAL exception. A snapshot that precedes binding completion preserves
the matching baseline's later replay watermark. Conflicting or insufficient
evidence fails startup; a covered membership entry can never disappear merely
because compaction removed it from the WAL.

This is Raft transport recovery state, not a Cluster Create operation
or membership workflow record. Config indices, a genesis completion tombstone,
the Raft-started marker, or a transport baseline require the matching server
state and segmented WAL to exist. Missing, oversized, truncated, or
contradictory state fails closed rather than replaying genesis.

The persisted state-machine watermark is the snapshot index, not every applied
WAL index. After restart, a post-snapshot tail remains invisible until Raft
legally reconfirms it with a current-term quorum; depending on the elected
leader, it is then committed as a prefix or overwritten. With no quorum the
Meta plane is unavailable rather than exposing an unconfirmed decision.
Client timeouts therefore mean an uncertain outcome and must be resolved by
the operation's stable idempotency key.

## Format compatibility

The Meta/Data control wire uses protocol v1 with a pre-release layout. Both
peers must use the same layout; earlier pre-release layouts have no
compatibility or negotiation path. This wire version is independent of the
durable schemas below. Source-history hold projection, frozen-source typed
bodies, and prepared activation are a homogeneous/coordinated rollout; mixed
binaries do not negotiate these capabilities.

The outer command, store, export, snapshot, and WAL envelopes use exact Meta
schema version 1. Embedded controlled-failover intent and phase blobs use their
own `KLFI`/`KLFP` version 2; terminal outcome (`KLFO`), unavailable proof
(`KLFU`), and failover-recovery store records remain at their own version 1.
These nested versions are strict format markers, not a mixed-version
negotiation mechanism.

Every configured Meta identity has one canonical concrete numeric
Data-control endpoint and one canonical concrete numeric Admin endpoint. The
NuRaft `srv_config::aux` `KMI2` descriptor carries the server id, derived
principal, and both endpoints; Raft keeps its endpoint in the native field.
The descriptor and committed identity binding must agree exactly. Advertised
Data-control and Admin addresses may route through an explicit proxy instead
of equaling their local process binds; restart can likewise rebind a Raft
listener behind a transport proxy without changing its durable advertised
endpoint. Endpoints are immutable, unique within their
respective directories, and change only through retirement and replacement
with a fresh server id. The previous partial `KMI1` development descriptor is
rejected and is not migrated. Durable
operation evidence includes its exact group id, reporter assignment and boot,
population identity, history, operation id, and evidence hash. Snapshot decoding rejects
malformed identity anchors and evidence that names a missing group or an
impossible future group/population epoch; older committed evidence remains
valid history after a group legitimately advances or the reporter moves.
The unreleased schema and segmented WAL evolve in place as v1. This label
does not guarantee compatibility with earlier development layouts: their
data directories are recreated rather than migrated. Keylane Meta does not
negotiate durable formats between mixed binary versions and has no in-band
schema-switch command. Incompatible changes require coordinated replacement
of the Meta cluster.
Readers reject unknown markers and trailing bytes so incompatible state fails
at startup or replay instead of being interpreted approximately. The
independent segmented-WAL marker follows the same fail-loudly rule.

## Authentication, membership, and audit

Raft transport is plaintext by default, matching the data-plane deployment
model. It still checks claimed source and destination ids against NuRaft
configuration descriptors and committed identity-store bindings, but those
claims are not cryptographically authenticated; deployments whose network is
not fully trusted enable optional mutual TLS. The Raft verifier requires
exactly one recognized canonical `keylane://meta/<server-id>` URI SAN but
ignores unrelated URI SANs; certificates reused by Data control are subject to
the stricter total-URI rule below. An IP or DNS SAN covers the advertised Raft
endpoint. The NuRaft configuration
identity descriptor, the CA-authenticated certificate, and the committed
identity-store binding must all match the claimed source id; neither the
configuration nor the store binding grants membership alone. During static
genesis, the complete config descriptor may temporarily stand in for a
not-yet-applied binding only while the durable initial-binding marker names
that unchanged descriptor set. The membership reconciler commits missing
bindings in server-id order; every member closes its local marker synchronously
when committed log or snapshot apply proves convergence. Transport checks identity
and reads recovery state without advancing that lifecycle. A dynamic waiting joiner
has a second narrow catch-up window only while its durable waiting marker is
present. Replaying a pre-add config cannot close that window: the marker is
removed only after the installed config includes the local id, every descriptor
binding is visible, and the state machine has applied through that config
index. The config can arrive before the earlier binding command. With
mTLS these windows also require the exact certificate identity; plaintext
deployments rely on network isolation. Ordinary replay uses only the exact
descriptor set in `transport_bindings.dat`, only below its recorded watermark;
at or above that cut a config descriptor never substitutes for a missing or
conflicting binding.

Initial identity recovery is not a Cluster Create child operation. The
existing `MetaMembershipReconciler` holds the shared membership gate, compares
the loaded genesis descriptors with the identity store, and proposes one
idempotent `BindMetaMember` at a time. Matching crash prefixes resume; any
descriptor conflict fails closed. Once this convergence is complete, the
same reconciler handles only ordinary reusable membership workflows.

Dynamic membership is a leader-owned `meta-membership-workflow-v1` operation.
Before either identity or NuRaft mutation, Admin commits a bounded versioned
intent containing the requested target, all three endpoints, principal, and
the baseline peer descriptors and identity bindings. Peer descriptors retain
voter/joiner flags, priority and data-center attributes; election-only config
log indices are not semantic membership changes. A recovered owner accepts
only that exact baseline or requested post-state, never overwrites a changed
peer set or reactivates a retired identity. Legacy partial changes without an
intent are not inferred as authorized workflows.

`MetaMembershipReconciler` scans the recovered non-terminal journal on each
leader transition. Add binds identity before invoking `add_srv`; remove
observes the committed configuration without the member before retiring its
identity. NuRaft's accepted invite/leave result is not a commit certificate.
The owner checks the actual committed configuration, checkpoints each phase,
and completes the operation only after all effects are present. Recovery also
handles a crash between an effect and its phase checkpoint. If the removal
target becomes leader during recovery, it yields leadership before another
leader continues the same removal.

Creation and membership operations share durable admission as well as one
leader-local lease. Identical in-flight membership requests attach to the
existing task; conflicting requests cannot bypass it after timeout or restart.
Generic Admin submit/complete/abort commands cannot create or abandon a
membership workflow. A timed-out invite can still commit, so cancelling its
wait does not release this reservation. Demotion joins only queued/local
NuRaft API entry and local proposals; remote-result callbacks own inert result
storage, not a reconciler or leader context. The next owner retries from the
committed state. Incompatible recovery retains an inspectable
`recovery-required` phase instead of guessing a rollback.
The retired binding also disambiguates the short interval after removal commits
but before NuRaft publishes its new in-memory configuration. Reactivation of
retired principals is rejected. Every member commits numeric Data-control and
Admin endpoints in canonical `IPv4:port` or `[IPv6]:port` spelling. Data seeds
use the former directory; operator discovery uses the latter. Neither
directory implies that every follower is currently reachable.
Data-node identities use canonical `keylane://node/<node-id>` principals with
global one-to-one binding.

Data control follows the Raft transport's optional mTLS mode instead of adding
a second Meta certificate configuration. The listener reuses that member's
Raft CA/certificate/key and its sole `keylane://meta/<server-id>` URI SAN. A
Data client reuses its replication TLS CA/certificate/key and must present its
committed sole `keylane://node/<node-id>` URI SAN. TLS is all-or-none on each
side; plaintext deployments rely on network isolation and never silently
downgrade a partially configured identity.

Local administration uses a mode-0600 Unix socket and derives a canonical
operator actor from Linux `SO_PEERCRED`, constrained by an explicit UID
allowlist. Its parent directory must not be group- or world-writable, and the
listener records the bound inode so shutdown never unlinks a replacement path.
Remote administration is plaintext when no control TLS identity is configured,
matching the Raft transport default. A plaintext listener grants operator
authority to every reachable peer and records the fixed
`keylane://operator/plaintext` actor, so trusted network reachability is its
security boundary. Deployments requiring authenticated peer identity configure
mutual TLS and use the peer's canonical URI SAN. Role-based authorization then
separates operators, Meta members, and data-node self-reporting; actor fields on
the wire are never trusted.
Certificate validity is enforced by TLS, but online issuance, rotation, CRL,
and OCSP integration are outside this module.
The `keylane-ctl` operator client uses one Raft-free Admin transport for
Unix, plaintext TCP, and mTLS TCP. Direct commands address the selected member;
`status` reports its local state. The `cluster-status` command discovers the
leader and evaluates cluster readiness. The transport handles partial I/O
under one absolute deadline. Direct commands support a TLS server-name
override; cluster discovery verifies each numeric Admin IP against the
certificate IP SAN and never falls back between TLS and plaintext. A Unix
seed can use configured TLS credentials for subsequent remote leader access.

`keylane-ctl cluster-status` normally performs exactly two reads:
`clusterhead 1` against the supplied seed to learn the current committed Admin
directory, then `clusterstatus 1` against the indicated leader. Redirect,
leader-change, busy, and incomplete-catch-up results retry discovery only
within the original deadline. Leader routing stays internal to the operator
API. The client reads this leader-observed cut without probing followers or
reporting their replication progress. A stable
result therefore states only leader-observed Meta availability and committed
membership consistency; a quorum-serving leader can report the cluster ready
while one follower is unreachable.

The leader builds `clusterstatus` from a compact state-machine view captured
under the same mutex as committed apply plus a Data-control runtime snapshot
captured first. Evaluation and encoding run on the bounded proposal executor,
not the Celer worker that drives Data heartbeats. Runtime entries exist only
after Hello, FDS application, and a current-view validation; replacement,
disconnect, demotion, and shutdown remove them. Health is timestamped on
receipt, while a lease decision becomes observable only after its Ack is
written, and replaying a cached Ack does not refresh it. Merging requires the
session, projection, assignment, group term, authority, grant, manifest, and
population anchors to match the committed cut. The result then passes a second
leader-alive, term, leadership-generation/eligibility, Raft-config, and
committed Meta-directory check; a changed bracket returns `cut_changed`
instead of mixed state. Captures are single-flight across both Admin listeners.
Completed replies release the capture permit before sending, share a 256 MiB
retained-reply budget, and a slow receiver loses the connection after five
seconds rather than delaying Data heartbeats. The compact committed cut also
carries whether a non-terminal `cluster-create-workflow-v1` root exists, its
phase, and only the declared Data ids needed for diagnostics. The server
exposes `cluster_create_active` plus specific `meta_catching_up`,
`data_unregistered`, `data_unregistered_retrying`, `data_unobserved`, and
`data_session_missing` blockers while preserving the `cluster-status` v1 wire
layout. `data_unobserved` means the current leader has no handshake evidence;
`data_session_missing` means a previously accepted or actively retrying node
has no current accepted session. A rejected,
parsed Data Hello is leader-generation-scoped observational evidence only; it
never authorizes a node. The operator uses the compact cut for its read-only
creation preflight without copying the journal. The leader repeats the check
under exclusive creation/membership admission before its first proposal.
Unrelated operation kinds do not make a clean topology appear occupied.

Readiness uses this leader-observed cut. Meta availability requires a live,
caught-up leader with quorum; membership stability compares its Raft config
with committed Meta identities and the complete unique Admin directory.
Topology convergence requires current projection plus fresh storage and
population facts for each active node referenced by committed groups. Serving
readiness requires complete slot coverage and, for every slot-owning group, a
committed owner/grant, present manifest, active policy, and a recent
successfully written lease grant matching the current session and authority.
Unassigned nodes remain diagnostic only. Empty and partially configured
clusters are stable `NOT READY` results.

`keylane-ctl cluster-create` reuses the same private leader discovery and
status-capture seam and accepts only manifest schema v1. A manifest names the
complete initial Meta vector—id plus canonical numeric Raft, Data-control, and
Admin endpoints—one or more canonical Data identities and numeric client
endpoints, and one or more Groups with exactly one primary and optional
replicas. Meta entries are sorted by id, all are voters, each endpoint class is
unique, and the principal derives as `keylane://meta/<id>`. Slots are either
generated with `contiguous-even` after sorting Group ids or supplied as a
complete, non-overlapping `0..16383` range table. All
declared Data belongs to exactly one Group and every Group owns at least one
slot. The parser rejects unknown TOML structure and files over 64 KiB, then
sorts nodes, Groups, replicas and ranges and merges adjacent ranges belonging
to the same Group. The CLI renders that canonical plan and requires exact
lowercase `yes` unless `--yes` is present. Only this normalized multi-Group
and multi-Meta shape is accepted under version 1; the earlier scalar-Meta
payload has no compatibility decoder.

After an empty-topology and no-active-create client check, the CLI sends one
`clustercreate 1` request to the discovered leader. `MetaCtlServer` commits
the entire normalized request as the intent of the existing
`cluster-create-workflow-v1` root operation before changing topology. Apply
reserves pristine state for that operation; a different creation id is
rejected, while exact-id replay remains legal. Admin only waits for the
durable result. A timeout or shutdown cancels the wait, not the operation, and
a repeated CLI invocation does not create a replacement for unfinished work.

`MetaClusterCreateReconciler` runs on the Meta worker after each caught-up
leader transition. Its atomic committed subscription includes the recovered
snapshot/WAL prefix; it scans the one non-terminal creation root and plans one
existing Meta command at a time from retained intent, phase, and actual
committed state. Every effect is checked before its phase checkpoint advances,
including recovery between those commits. Subscription overflow reacquires the
complete view. The reconciler uses the trusted coordinator actor for follow-up
proposals; the original operator remains recorded on the root operation.
Creation and Meta membership changes share admission, with the durable active
operation check covering handoff, timeout, and restart.

Before changing Data topology, the root remains in `wait-meta-barrier`. Its
submit log index is the fixed barrier `B`: every remote member in the genesis
configuration must have a recent transport-verified response and report a
state-machine commit index at least `B`. NuRaft peer-SM tracking remains
enabled on followers so their responses carry that index. A leader enables it
only while this phase is active, because the same NuRaft switch also delays
ordinary client completion until every peer applies the write; outside the
genesis barrier, leader proposals retain normal majority availability. The
reconciler also requires exact agreement among the manifest Meta vector,
NuRaft descriptors, committed
identity bindings, and both advertised Meta directories. It never calls
`add_srv`; initial membership already exists as the full genesis
configuration. Cluster Create retains the shared membership admission gate
through completion, so ordinary membership changes cannot invalidate this
barrier or the retained creation intent.

The reconciler registers Data in node-id order, creates Groups in Group-id
order, assigns primary before sorted replicas, begins term 1, and replaces the
whole Slot map with one `SetSlotMap` carrying every canonical range and each
Group's config epoch. It installs one shared `keylane.cluster-create-v1`
policy, then uses the existing population store, replication-state command,
and finite authority command to anchor a sparse manifest containing only each
Group's slots and grant that Group to its declared primary. No separate
persistent topology or creation-state model exists.

Only current, boot-bound Data sessions that acknowledge the complete
projection permit population initialization. Each Group receives one stable,
domain-separated `cluster-create-v1` child operation. Its primary first gets
the existing source-less empty-population directive. After that exact success
receipt commits, the child installs one existing `authorize-source` and one
`rebuild` directive per replica in a single revision. The projector sends
the authorization immediately but withholds each rebuild until its matching
authorization success is durable. The rebuild completion means the existing
replication manager has activated the population and established its native
replication session; subsequent heartbeats supply the population-current READY
evidence.

Group children execute in canonical Group order. Exact directive identities,
attempts, boots, histories, assignments, terms, grants, manifests,
partition epochs, and source flow layouts make reconnect replay safe without
minting another attempt. Primary and replica worker counts may differ: flow
identity follows the source and native replication maps those flows onto the
target's workers.
A deterministic failure fences only that Group before aborting its child and
then the root; already completed Groups are not rolled back. While population
work is unfinished, a current Data session with a different target boot or
source boot/history invalidates the attempt. The reconciler durably removes
its directives and records the reason before fencing and aborting, so Meta
recovery does not depend on retaining the detecting session. Committed success
receipts remain immutable history; they do not establish readiness for a new
boot. Other incompatible topology changes stop at an inspectable
`recovery-required` phase. Neither path authorizes another destructive
initialization. After every child completes, the root completes and Admin
returns the stable Group ids, child operation ids, and their committed
population proof indices.

Demotion and shutdown cancel the owner and join its local proposal work while
the worker and executor remain live. Already accepted proposals may commit;
cancellation never synthesizes a Data result, rolls back committed topology,
or adds a compensating fence. The next leader re-reads authoritative effects.
Creation, Meta membership, and operator-triggered controlled failover have
dedicated background drivers. Data migration, detector-triggered uncontrolled
failover, and arbitrary operation kinds still require their own recovery
policy; journal persistence alone supplies none.

The client then polls the ordinary cluster-status v1 wire until roles,
membership, topology, sparse population state, and recent authority evidence
match the complete manifest. Node failures use existing blockers with
`node:<id>` scope and identify the Group plus missing session, projection,
health, or population conditions. Finally the CLI invokes `redis-cli` to
exercise every Group's primary and verify `MOVED`, `CROSSSLOT`,
`CLUSTER INFO`, `CLUSTER SLOTS`, and normal key operations. This makes
success mean the declared multi-Group data plane is usable, not merely that a
metadata prefix committed.

Every privileged committed command creates a deterministic audit record keyed
by Raft log index. Records include the injected actor, proposal time, command
summary, verdict, and a rolling hash linked to the previous record. Exports
carry the preceding anchor and record hashes so an external archive can verify
continuity and deduplicate by log index and record hash within its own
deployment namespace; Keylane persists no separate cluster identity. Pruning
advances the committed chain anchor only through an explicitly named record.
`SetAuditPolicy` is itself replicated and always audited, including a
transition into or out of disabled mode.
