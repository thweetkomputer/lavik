// Cluster owner-side authority re-check plumbing shared by command.cpp and the
// per-type multi-key executors (invariant 1 choke point 2).
//
// The dispatch gate captures AuthorityGuard's complete admission proof on
// CommandRequest (cluster_authority_admission_ / ClusterSlots()). A topology,
// session, lease, or fence change can invalidate that proof while a command
// suspends. Early one-shot and tx::Transaction checks reject stale work before
// expensive handlers run; a storage-neutral MutationPrecondition carries the
// same proof across later suspensions and checks again at logical publication.
//
// Every entry point is a no-op in standalone mode, for replication replay, and
// for requests without a captured admission, so non-cluster behavior is
// unchanged. Definitions live in src/redis/command.cpp.
