// MetaCoordinator is the in-process API for control sessions and ordinary
// reconcilers: consumers see commands, committed views, commit subscriptions,
// and reconciler lifecycle rather than Raft types. Process-wired membership
// and genesis-barrier reconcilers additionally receive the raft_server for
// configuration changes or peer progress, but still submit state-machine
// effects only through the coordinator.
//
// ASSEMBLY, OWNERSHIP, AND DESTRUCTION ORDER
//
// The caller owns the state machine and leader-local observation store; both
// outlive the coordinator. A shared MetaRaft reference keeps accepted proposals
// connected to their result owner. Process teardown stops workflow owners and
// ingress, drains proposal submission, then joins MetaRaft before draining the
// Bycorf foreign mailbox. The state machine outlives all Go callbacks. The
// coordinator destructor drains in-flight proposals, cancels and joins all
// registered reconcilers, detaches the commit-event sink, and cancels every
// live subscription before it returns. A Propose task dropped by its caller
// detaches (below). The commit-event sink is detached under the state machine's
// sink mutex, so the commit thread never calls into a half-destroyed
// coordinator.
//
// THREAD MODEL
//
//   - Propose is a bycorf::Task coroutine. Everything before the first
//     suspension — leader check, fail-safe gates, ValidateProposal hooks,
//     actor injection, encoding — runs SYNCHRONOUSLY on the
//     caller's thread. Hooks that read the observation store therefore
//     require the caller to run on the coordinator's owner thread (the bycorf
//     worker in production). The observation store is internally serialized
//     because commit-driven revalidation runs on the dispatch thread.
//   - The commit round trip suspends. Submission goes through the injected
//     proposal executor before entering Raft's mutation path, so WAL work
//     never blocks the production Bycorf worker. Short read-only role/config
//     checks remain on the caller. Completion then goes through the injected
//     options.foreign_executor_ — production resumes through Bycorf's target
//     worker mailbox so the continuation (and the awaiting reconciler) lands
//     back on its owner. There is deliberately no implicit inline fallback:
//     a coordinator attached to Raft requires this executor, preventing a
//     Raft or timeout thread from accidentally running Bycorf-owned code.
//     Plain-thread tests opt into an explicit inline policy. A Propose task
//     destroyed while suspended is SAFE: the awaiter detaches, and the late
//     Raft completion fills a shared waiter and resumes nothing.
//   - Commit events: the MetaStateMachine invokes the coordinator's sink from
//     its commit thread, under the state mutex, right after ApplyCommitted
//     (MetaCommitEventSink, state_machine.h). The sink is O(1) and never
//     blocks (bounded enqueue + notify only). A dedicated dispatch thread per
//     coordinator delivers queued events to subscriber callbacks; callbacks
//     run on THAT thread, serialize per subscription, and must be quick and
//     never block indefinitely.
//   - Leadership transitions: BecomeLeader()/BecomeFollower() are wired from
//     MetaRaft's ordered role callback (tests may drive them directly). The
//     protocol owner must not wait, so both are O(1) queue pushes onto the
//     coordinator's leadership thread; reconciler Start()/CancelAndWait()
//     always run on that thread, strictly serialized per reconciler.
//   - Propose timeouts: a dedicated timer thread walks a deadline queue
//     (options_.propose_timeout_ms_). It touches only weak references to
//     proposal waiters, never coordinator state, so it is teardown-safe.
//     Completion is FIRST-WINS between the raft callback and the timeout.
//   - Lock order: SM state mutex -> SM sink mutex -> subscription core mutex.
//     The coordinator never calls into the state machine while holding the
//     subscription core mutex (the atomic triple uses a two-phase retry read,
//     see SubscribeCaptured), so the order is never inverted.
//
// TRUST BOUNDARY
//
// Every privileged command carries an ActorContext that only a TRUSTED ENTRY
// may inject. Propose takes an AuthenticatedPrincipal, which can only be
// CONSTRUCTED with a MetaPrincipalPasskey — a passkey whose own constructor
// is private and friended to exactly the trusted entries: the ctl surface
// (MetaCtlServer, authorized by UDS credentials, mTLS identity, or explicit
// plaintext-listener reachability), the
// coordinator itself (it mints the internal actor LeaderContext proposes
// with), and the
// test peer. Copying an existing principal inside trusted code is allowed;
// untrusted code can never mint one. The coordinator stamps readable_time
// from the system clock at propose time — reading the clock HERE is legal
// because this is the proposal entry point. Apply never reads a clock; it
// copies the injected text into the audit record.
