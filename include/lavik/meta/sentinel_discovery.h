// Pure mapping from Meta authority snapshots to Redis Sentinel discovery
// answers. This layer owns no sockets, no locks, and no timers: every decision
// is a function of one MetaDiscoveryCut, so the complete publication matrix is
// unit-testable without a runtime. The Sentinel server supplies the cut from
// the committed state machine projection plus the two thread-safe observation
// registries; it never reads MetaObservationStore here.
//
// Core invariants:
//   - Authority gates come from committed state: lifecycle Created, client
//     mode Single, exactly one committed Group, an active authority grant, and
//     a non-retired Owner with an endpoint selected by local publication
//     policy. Observation health never gates publication; it only sets flags.
//   - o_down is never emitted. Objective withdrawal of a Primary is expressed
//     by retracting publication (null address / omitted entry), because a
//     fenced or replaced Owner must never be announced as a master again.
//   - Local policy selects plaintext or TLS independently of the query socket.
//     Missing selected endpoints withdraw publication without affecting
//     authority. Hostnames require explicit opt-in; IP projection uses an
//     asynchronous local resolver snapshot. Admin/Raft/Data-control endpoints
//     never appear here.
//   - Sentinel flags stay parseable by stock redis-py 8.1.0 / go-redis: the
//     tokens master/slave/s_down/disconnected/master_down in the same
//     comma-separated order real Redis 7.2 uses (s_down first, then role).
