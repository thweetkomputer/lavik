// AuthorityGuard: the single request-path authority boundary for the cluster
// data plane. CaptureAndAdmit records routing plus finite-lease state;
// RegisterAndRecheck closes the publication race and keeps a stale admission
// from overtaking a fence, and RecheckAtMutation enforces the same proof at
// the storage publication cut after intervening suspension.
//
// Admit() and AuthorityUnchanged() remain pure routing/test helpers over
// committed ServingState values; they do not carry a lease generation,
// deadline, or in-flight registration and therefore are not safe substitutes
// for AuthorityGuard on a request path. Wire mapping
// (MOVED/CLUSTERDOWN/CROSSSLOT/LOADING text) lives in the Redis layer.
