// MetaStateApply is the metadata control plane's apply dispatcher and the
// pure-function core of ApplyCommitted. MetaStateMachine calls it from
// commit() on every node with the committed command, its raft log index, and
// the ActorContext fields the trusted entry injected at Propose time.
//
// Contract:
//   - DETERMINISTIC PURE FUNCTION of (committed state, command, log index,
//     injected actor fields). It never reads a clock (readable_time is
//     caller-injected text copied verbatim into the audit record), never
//     touches observation state, never does IO, and takes no locks
//     (concurrency control lives in the state machine above).
//   - NEVER FAIL-STOPS on domain input. A cleanly decoded command that
//     violates a domain or cross-store rule is REJECTED: the log index is
//     consumed, an audit record is written, committed state is unchanged.
//     Fail-stop (spdlog::critical + abort inside the stores on broken
//     index/capacity correspondence) remains the stores' wiring-bug semantic;
//     correct wiring — log indexes strictly increasing from 1, with the
//     coordinator reserving audit-window capacity — never reaches it.
//   - AUDIT: every privileged command appends exactly one audit
//     record keyed by its raft log index, accepted or rejected, carrying the
//     injected actor principal, a deterministic command summary, the verdict,
//     and the injected readable time. Replay of the same log index reproduces
//     the identical record and the audit store's Append is then an idempotent
//     no-op, so replay never grows the window.
//   - REPLAY IDEMPOTENCY: re-applying the same (log_index, command) pair
//     yields the same verdict and the same state. The stores implement the
//     "post-effect already present with identical content -> idempotent
//     accept" rule; the cross-store checks below are phrased so a command's
//     own post-effect never flips their outcome (the checks either read state
//     the command cannot move, or are skipped once the effect is in place).
//
// Cross-store invariants enforced HERE (the stores expose fact queries; this
// layer is the only place that sees all six stores):
//   1. principal vs grant: the target node of AssignNodeToGroup and
//      ActivateAuthority must be a registered, non-retired node (identity
//      store).
//   2. ActivateAuthority validates the Group term/authority, topology epoch,
//      active identity and membership before atomically changing its owner
//      and authority. Compound transitions retain affected records for
//      rollback.
//   3. one-node-one-group cross-store half: an AssignNodeToGroup that would
//      move a node into a group it is not currently a member of requires the
//      node to hold no current membership and no active grant. "Grant owner
//      => member of the group" is maintained by the ActivateAuthority member
//      check (2) and by rejecting RemoveNodeFromGroup of a grant owner, so
//      the grant fact is read through the node's current group. Operation
//      intents remain opaque and do not create implicit node obligations.
//   4. A Created cluster always has both registered current global Policies.
//   5. Remaining cross-domain facts: group existence and membership CAS live
//      in the stores; RetireNode is additionally rejected while the node
//      still holds group membership (which, by the invariant in (3), also
//      covers an active grant).
//   6. TransitionOperationPhase retains only affected records for rollback
//      and enforces the supported task kinds, count and bounded payload budget.
//      Apply never constructs a node projection or network byte buffer.
//   7. Live directives remain valid after later committed mutations. After
//      every accepted command, apply rechecks their exact source/target
//      assignments, active Group Term, and population
//      identity, removes stale attempts, and bumps each affected operation's
//      CAS revision once. CommitDirectiveResult repeats the same check before
//      first commit; snapshot recovery and projection reject any stale entry
//      that bypassed this invariant.
//   8. SetSlotMap first inspects the command's absolute slot map and rejects
//      any slot-ownership change that affects a group with an
//      active grant. Source and destination groups must be fenced before the
//      cut, so no lease issued for the old projection can span a slot move.
//   9. A root ClusterCreate submission and the topology store's transition
//      from Uninitialized to Creating are one aggregate apply. Root completion
//      or abort atomically enters Created or ProvisioningFailed. Exact replay
//      must observe both halves; lifecycle, rather than retained operation
//      history or manifest equality, permanently rejects another Genesis.
//      Creating also holds the existing Meta-membership workflow gate.
//  10. An active failover transition freezes its group membership,
//      replication-state, slot/config, term, and authority anchors. Ordinary
//      commands that would change those anchors reject until the transition
//      terminates; exact replay and the documented same-grant semantic no-op
//      remain admissible.
//  11. Failover Begin requires no active transition and validates its frozen
//      committed anchors; every post-Begin mutation validates the exact
//      transition revision. Mutations spanning topology and/or
//      operation state apply deltas under the state-machine write lock,
//      retaining only affected records until domain validation succeeds.
//      Rejection restores those records before releasing the lock; no full
//      store or MetaStores copy is part of apply.
//      Restore revalidates transition-id uniqueness, coherence with the
//      Group's current authority and membership, and the Controlled
//      transition's exact pristine operation link.
//
// MetaStores is the committed aggregate that snapshots serialize as one
// versioned envelope: per-store length-prefixed versioned blobs in a fixed
// order. Deserialize is strict and revalidates
// authority anchors, active identities/policies, and retained manifest
// documents before exposing any decoded store; every failure is
// MetaFailureClass::kFailStop — the same bytes fail
// identically on every node.
