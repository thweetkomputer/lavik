// MetaStateApply is the metadata control plane's apply dispatcher and the
// pure-function core of ApplyCommitted. MetaStateMachine calls it from
// commit() on every node with the committed command, its raft log index, and
// the ActorContext fields the trusted entry injected at Propose time.
//
// Contract:
//   - DETERMINISTIC PURE FUNCTION of (committed state, command, log index,
//     injected actor fields). It never reads a clock (readable_time is
//     caller-injected text copied verbatim into the audit record), never
//     touches observation state, never does IO, and takes no locks
//     (concurrency control lives in the state machine above).
//   - NEVER FAIL-STOPS on domain input. A cleanly decoded command that
//     violates a domain or cross-store rule is REJECTED: the log index is
//     consumed, an audit record is written, committed state is unchanged.
//     Fail-stop (spdlog::critical + abort inside the stores on broken
//     index/capacity correspondence) remains the stores' wiring-bug semantic;
//     correct wiring — log indexes strictly increasing from 1, with the
//     coordinator reserving audit-window capacity — never reaches it.
//   - AUDIT: every privileged command appends exactly one audit
//     record keyed by its raft log index, accepted or rejected, carrying the
//     injected actor principal, a deterministic command summary, the verdict,
//     and the injected readable time. Replay of the same log index reproduces
//     the identical record and the audit store's Append is then an idempotent
//     no-op, so replay never grows the window.
//   - REPLAY IDEMPOTENCY: re-applying the same (log_index, command) pair
//     yields the same verdict and the same state. The stores implement the
//     "post-effect already present with identical content -> idempotent
//     accept" rule; the cross-store checks below are phrased so a command's
//     own post-effect never flips their outcome (the checks either read state
//     the command cannot move, or are skipped once the effect is in place).
//
// Cross-store invariants enforced HERE (the stores expose fact queries; this
// layer is the only place that sees all eight stores):
//   1. principal vs grant: the target node of AssignNodeToGroup,
//      GrantAuthority, and ActivateAuthority must be a registered, non-retired
//      node (identity store).
//   2. RetirePolicy: rejected while either an active grant or a non-terminal
//      operation's structured policy-reference list names the version.
//      Operation intents remain opaque; callers must put safety-relevant
//      policy dependencies in that committed list.
//   3. ActivateAuthority atomicity: grant-store ValidateActivate plus every
//      topology-side check (topology_epoch exactly current+1, new owner is a
//      group member and registered active, grant policy version active) all
//      run BEFORE any write; only then the grant half (ApplyGrantPart) and
//      the topology half (owner, authority_version, topology_epoch,
//      config_epoch) are written in order. Any rejection leaves both halves
//      untouched.
//   4. one-node-one-group cross-store half: an AssignNodeToGroup that would
//      move a node into a group it is not currently a member of requires the
//      node to hold no current membership and no active grant. "Grant owner
//      => member of the group" is maintained by the ActivateAuthority member
//      check (3) and by rejecting RemoveNodeFromGroup of a grant owner, so
//      the grant fact is read through the node's current group. Operation
//      intents remain opaque and do not create implicit node obligations.
//   5. The policy version referenced by GrantAuthority/ActivateAuthority must
//      be committed and non-retired (policy store IsVersionActive).
//   6. Remaining cross-domain facts: group existence and membership CAS live
//      in the stores; RetireNode is additionally rejected while the node
//      still holds group membership (which, by the invariant in (4), also
//      covers an active grant).
//   7. TransitionOperationPhase is applied to a candidate operation store and
//      the exact FullDesiredState for every old/new directive recipient is
//      projected and encoded before commit. This aggregate check prevents
//      individually valid operations from making a node's projection exceed
//      protocol count, field, or total-object limits; rejection leaves the
//      operation store unchanged.
//   8. Live directives remain valid after later committed mutations. After
//      every accepted command, apply rechecks their exact source/target
//      assignments, active term/authority/grant revision, and population
//      identity, removes stale attempts, and bumps each affected operation's
//      CAS revision once. CommitDirectiveResult repeats the same check before
//      first commit; snapshot recovery and projection reject any stale entry
//      that bypassed this invariant.
//   9. SetSlotMap first constructs the complete candidate topology and rejects
//      any slot-ownership or config-epoch change that affects a group with an
//      active grant. Source and destination groups must be fenced before the
//      cut, so no lease issued for the old projection can span a slot move.
//  10. Creation and Meta-membership workflows have one shared durable
//      reservation. A new cluster-create workflow reserves pristine topology
//      before its first mutation and excludes another active creation id.
//      Exact-id replay resolves before this guard, even after topology is
//      populated.
//  11. A live controlled failover owns its group's recovery and authority
//      mutations. Apply revalidates the typed operation/recovery relation on
//      every replica; in particular, an operation receipt and the independently
//      versioned recovery record cannot race to discard a committed exact
//      frozen-source result.
//
// MetaStores is the committed aggregate that snapshots serialize as one
// versioned envelope: per-store length-prefixed versioned blobs in a fixed
// order. Deserialize is strict and revalidates the cross-store group set,
// authority anchors, active identities/policies, and retained manifest
// documents before exposing any decoded store; every failure is
// MetaFailureClass::kFailStop — the same bytes fail
// identically on every node.
