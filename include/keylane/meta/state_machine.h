// MetaStateMachine is the metadata control plane's NuRaft `state_machine`.
// It owns the committed aggregate `MetaStores` (six stores) and applies every
// committed entry through
// the deterministic pure function ApplyCommitted (see state_apply.h).
//
// commit() and failure classification:
//   - commit() decodes the entry with the committed command codec. A DECODE
//   FAILURE
//     IS FAIL-STOP (spdlog::critical + abort, the system_exit policy): the
//     same byte sequence fails identically on every node, so aborting cannot
//     fork the group. This is strictly separate from a domain rejection,
//     which is a cleanly decoded command refused by ApplyCommitted: the index
//     is consumed, an audit record written, committed state unchanged, and
//     the commit thread keeps going.
//   - ACTOR SOURCING: ApplyCommitted takes the trusted entry's injected
//     ActorContext fields (actor_principal, readable_time) and copies them
//     into the audit record. commit() reads them from the decoded command's
//     `actor_` field — the wire encoding carries both as ordinary bounded
//     strings (commands.h), so every node applies with the same actor.
//     Unforgeability is an entry-layer property (only the trusted
//     ctl/coordinator entries construct commands), not this
//     codec's.
//
// Recovery and durability of last_commit_index, verified against the pinned
// NuRaft revision:
//   The stores are volatile and rebuilt by replay; durability comes from
//   snapshots. The commit index is persisted ONLY as part of a snapshot (it
//   equals the snapshot's last_log_idx). After a restart the core initializes
//   quick_commit_index_/sm_commit_index_ from last_commit_index() (the
//   snapshot index) and does NOT immediately replay the WAL tail: the tail is
//   re-confirmed through the normal leader path once the new leader's
//   current-term entry reaches quorum, and an uncommitted tail is eventually
//   either legally committed as a prefix or truncated. No node exposes tail
//   state before quorum re-confirmation.
//   Consequently commit() MAY BE INVOKED REPEATEDLY for the same index: a
//   committed entry already applied before a crash is re-applied after it.
//   Correctness rests on replay idempotency (absolute-value
//   commands + "effect already present with identical content -> idempotent
//   accept" + audit records keyed by log index), never on at-most-once
//   delivery. Persisting last_commit_index per commit would be wrong: NuRaft
//   never re-applies entries at or below last_commit_index(), so a watermark
//   newer than the durable stores would silently drop acknowledged writes.
//
// Snapshot contract:
//   - EXACT CUT POINT: create_snapshot() serializes MetaStores under the state
//     mutex synchronously, so the captured bytes hold the state of exactly the
//     snapshot's last_log_idx. The aggregate is bounded by
//     kMaxMetaSnapshotBytes but may be large, and this capture contributes
//     directly to commit/proposal latency. Automatic snapshots run
//     on the commit thread at a commit boundary (handle_commit.cxx:
//     snapshot_and_compact right after sm_commit_index_ advances), and MANUAL
//     snapshots must go through create_snapshot({serialize_commit_=true}) or
//     schedule_snapshot_creation() — the ctl `snapshot` path in meta_main
//     does — so no commit can interleave between the index read and the
//     capture. Without that serialization the captured state could be newer
//     than the snapshot index (safe via replay idempotency, but not exact).
//   - ASYNC WRITE: the framed image is handed to the dedicated snapshot
//     writer thread, which performs the file IO (tmp + fdatasync + rename +
//     directory fsync) and only then invokes when_done — snapshot publication
//     does not block the commit thread on durability IO. The core compacts the
//     log only after when_done(true) (on_snapshot_completed), so a durable
//     snapshot always precedes log truncation. A write failure rejects the
//     snapshot via when_done(false), which only skips this compaction round;
//     consecutive failures are counted by consecutive_snapshot_failures() for
//     replay observability and alerting.
//   - SIZE FAIL-SAFE: MetaStores::Serialize fails beyond
//     kMaxMetaSnapshotBytes; create_snapshot rejects the round and
//     alerts instead of silently truncating.
//   - TRANSMISSION: NuRaft's logical-object API; object N is the Nth
//     kSnapshotObjectBytes chunk of the snapshot's serialized MetaStores
//     envelope (bounded objects, O(1) per read). An open read stream pins its
//     snapshot against pruning until free_user_snp_ctx — pruning mid-stream
//     would make the core restart the follower's sync from object zero with
//     the newest snapshot on every catch-up round.
//   - RECEIVE SIDE: save_logical_snp_obj accumulates the envelope and writes
//     the snapshot file before apply_snapshot() loads it — a received
//     snapshot is durable before it is applied; apply_snapshot() returning
//     false is the core's designed path into state_mgr::system_exit.
//     Apply synchronously reconciles membership through the attached state
//     manager before publishing the replacement stores; startup redoes that
//     reconciliation from the durable snapshot if any intermediate write was
//     interrupted. Ordinary committed apply also closes local binding lifecycle
//     markers synchronously, independently of transport callbacks.
//     Assembly is POSITIONALLY EXACTLY-ONCE: NuRaft has no in-flight guard on
//     install_snapshot requests (the leader resends the current sync-ctx
//     offset on every append tick until a response advances it, client
//     timeouts recreate the request on a fresh connection, and stale
//     responses can regress the ctx offset), so the same object may arrive
//     any number of times. Offset-addressed assembly absorbs duplicates, but
//     a plain byte stream cannot. The receiver appends only the
//     object whose id equals the assembly cursor receiving_next_obj_
//     (is_first_obj restarts assembly, covering the leader's sync-ctx
//     timeout/restart), acknowledges every object with the cursor value
//     (pull semantics: stale/duplicate responses can never pull the leader
//     past a hole), and writes the file only when the is_last object
//     completes the sequence — a holed stream never produces a file. The
//     framed checksum + strict envelope decode remain the backstop, not the
//     mechanism.
//
// Snapshot files (`snapshot_<last_log_idx>.dat`, all integers little-endian):
//   magic u32 ("MSN1") | meta_len u32 | meta (nuraft::snapshot::serialize()) |
//   payload_len u32 | payload (MetaStores envelope) | checksum u32
//   checksum := FNV-1a32 over every byte between magic and itself.
// The latest snapshot file is retained, plus any pinned by an open read
// stream.
//
// Threading and IO model: NuRaft calls commit/create_snapshot/read...obj on
// its commit and snapshot threads; all state is mutex-guarded. Only the
// writer thread performs create-side durability IO; receive-side writes stay
// inline on the core's snapshot-sync thread. Lock order
// is mutex_ -> io_mutex_; the writer thread never holds both in the reverse
// order.
