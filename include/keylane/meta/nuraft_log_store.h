// NuraftLogStore is a NuRaft `log_store` backed by one WAL v1 segmented log
// per server.
//
// WAL v1 layout (`data_dir`):
//   log-<first_idx>.seg   one segment per index range; <first_idx> is the
//                         first log index the segment can hold, pinned again
//                         in the segment header
//   compact-<first_idx>.ready
//                         fsynced compact intent; recovery finishes replacing
//                         the old segment set before scanning the WAL
//   compact-<first_idx>.ready.tmp
//                         unpublished compact replacement; safe to discard
// Segments roll when the active segment reaches the size cap (default
// 64 MiB, configurable via Open); a segment may exceed the cap by one record
// (the cap is a roll trigger checked before placing each record, never a
// hard record-size limit). compact(last_log_index) — always called by the
// core once the state machine made the snapshot at that index durable —
// rewrites the complete surviving suffix into a fresh segment named
// log-<last_log_index+1>.seg, so post-compact segment boundaries coincide
// with snapshot compact boundaries. A full compaction leaves that segment
// header-only to pin start_index.
//
// INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE LEGACY SINGLE-FILE LAYOUT: Open fails clearly when
// `data_dir` holds `raft_log.dat`. Legacy directories carry no production
// data; the remedy is to wipe the directory, not to migrate.
//
// Durability contract with the Raft core (verified against the pinned NuRaft
// source, third_party/nuraft @ 0b01b18), including segment-file metadata:
//   - append()/write_at() pwrite records but never fsync. NuRaft always
//     follows a batch of writes with exactly one sync point before the
//     append result becomes visible: end_of_append_batch() after every
//     append_entries batch on both leader (handle_client_request.cxx) and
//     follower (handle_append_entries.cxx), and flush() inside
//     store_log_entry() for conf entries (raft_server.cxx, split-brain
//     guard). Those two hooks fdatasync the active segment here, plus an
//     fsync of the data directory when segment files were created, renamed,
//     or unlinked since the last sync — record bytes, ftruncate size changes,
//     and directory metadata are all pinned to those two hooks, so a crash
//     can only resurrect state from an append batch that was never acked
//     (Raft reconverges such tails through the normal consistency check).
//   - The segment rolled away from is fdatasynced before its descriptor
//     closes, so an intact non-tail segment on disk is always complete.
//   - write_at(index) ftruncates the segment holding `index` at the record
//     boundary and unlinks every later segment before writing, so a reopened
//     store never sees the overwritten tail past the last sync point as
//     anything but a torn tail (see below).
//   - compact() performs its own durability eagerly. It fsyncs a complete
//     replacement as a non-WAL ready intent before removing the old set;
//     recovery finishes a published intent after a crash. Failures before
//     publication return `false` without changing live or durable authority;
//     an unrecoverable cleanup failure after publication fails stop. NuRaft
//     only compacts after the state machine has made the snapshot durable
//     (on_snapshot_completed runs after create_snapshot's callback), so a
//     crash cannot leave compacted logs without a durable snapshot.
//
// On-disk format (all integers little-endian):
//   segment  := segment_header record*
//   segment_header := magic u32 ("LSEG") | format_version u32 (=1) |
//                     first_index u64 | checksum u32
//   record   := magic u32 ("LRA1") | index u64 | term u64 | type u8 |
//               has_crc32 u8 | crc32 u32 | timestamp_us u64 |
//               payload_len u32 | payload bytes | checksum u32
//   checksum := FNV-1a32 over every preceding byte of the header/record.
// The segment header pins first_index so a fully compacted (record-less)
// floor segment still reopens at the right index.
//
// Recovery first completes a synced compact ready intent, if present. It then
// scans segments in first_index order and rebuilds the
// in-memory index as an exact mirror of the intact on-disk prefix. Records
// must be contiguous within and across segments. The first anomaly — a short
// or checksum-mismatched record, a sequence gap, a bad segment header — is
// treated as a torn tail: the intact prefix is kept, the current segment is
// ftruncated at the anomaly offset (a torn header-only segment is recreated
// header-only so the compaction floor survives), and every later segment
// file is unlinked. Bytes past the anomaly were never acked in their current
// form: the anomaly is either a crash mid-pwrite or the remnant of an
// interrupted write_at/apply_pack truncation, both of which cut at or above
// the uncommitted tail (committed prefixes are never overwritten in Raft).
// A checksum-valid header with an unsupported version is incompatible data,
// not a torn tail: Open rejects it before mutating any recovery files.
//
// Threading and IO model: every method takes the internal mutex and performs
// synchronous pwrite/fdatasync on the calling NuRaft thread. NuRaft drives
// log writes from its append/commit background threads and request handlers,
// which are allowed to block on storage (the asio path behaves the same);
// the meta plane deliberately keeps durability IO out of bycorf coroutines.
//
// Failure behavior: Open() reports errors via absl::Status. pwrite failures
// inside append/write_at/apply_pack cannot be propagated through NuRaft's
// interface, and continuing would ack non-durable data, so they log a fatal
// message and abort (same policy as NuraftStateMgr::system_exit). flush()
// and compact() instead return `false`, the error channel NuRaft designed
// for them.
//
// Ownership: the store owns the active segment's file descriptor and closes
// it on destruction. Entries are cloned in and out (NuRaft buffers embed a
// cursor, so sharing instances across threads is unsafe); the segment files
// are the source of truth, the in-memory index an exact mirror of them.
