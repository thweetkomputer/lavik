"""Stale or incarnation-forged observations never reach committed state.

One 3-node cluster; serial phases:

1. Register a data node and build the committed anchors observation
   freshness checks match against: group g1 promoted to term 1
   (creategroup + begingroupterm).
2. Trusted session gen=1 adopted through the ctl session adapter;
   a candidate observation carrying the correct committed term is ACCEPTED
   and visible through the facts-filtered query path.
3. Forgery matrix, every entry rejected AND written to the obs audit ring:
   stale session generation (after the generation advanced), future group
   term, stale partition replication epoch, old boot incarnation under the
   current generation, and an unregistered node. The generation bump itself
   purged the earlier candidate (superseded-by-generation audit event).
4. Operation evidence lifecycle: a history binding committed via
   transitionop lets evidence be ACCEPTED while the operation is live;
   forged evidence (unbound history) is rejected and the operation never
   advances on it; after completeop retires the operation the same
   well-formed evidence is rejected (operation-unknown-or-terminal) and the
   commit-driven RevalidateAll drop appears as commit-stale in the ring.
5. Leader-local semantics: kill -9 the leader; the NEW leader's store is
   empty (candidate query returns zero) until the node re-reports through a
   fresh session on the new leader. Committed history is verified
   unaffected by all observation traffic.
